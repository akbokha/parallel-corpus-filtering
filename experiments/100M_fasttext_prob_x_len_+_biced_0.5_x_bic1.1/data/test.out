28 @-@ year @-@ old Koch found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother told him that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the judicial branch in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had taken his dream job six months ago as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shocked and destroyed .
&quot; we are a small team that works like a tight family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends during this difficult time .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank lived in Host@@ els first , but that &quot; things for him were finally going uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; combining his way with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is requested to call the sign@@ post of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston should not always be perfect or successful .
&quot; in an interview , the Hollywood star made it unmistak@@ ably clear . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or get stuck on the outside label , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather snow@@ ing me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress loves spending her time at home , a television with a relaxed de@@ bris and Mexican food , that is , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she asks the question of the desire for children to be white : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid of sport &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the for@@ age trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with that the riding career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family run over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he was not even photograph@@ ing for photography . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting help handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the golden pyramid of sports .
there is no lack of awards to the li@@ ke@@ able athlete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of sports .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the participants include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ver , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jumping horse Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Award went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; the two US presidential candidates , however , are not at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt small and cau@@ tions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the contrary , would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely go back regul@@ ators , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ally . &quot;
the democratic candidate canc@@ els the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could be some party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US .
oil production should also be possible in protected areas ; it wants to announce the Par@@ isian climate protection treaty .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly strengthen the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign them . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , &quot; The minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , &quot; he says , he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every escaped woman experiences sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is an almost everyday occurrence for women who flee their own lives .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house provides shelter .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the escape : &quot; many secretly steal away from it , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; the fact that tu@@ g@@ boats for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who thinks that end as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr recalls . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ sed , they appreciate . &quot;
some of the children are certainly not voluntarily born .
many women are used to saying nothing .
or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big .
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether or not they knew from a similar project as in Munich , some say no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stor@@ eys in some common shel@@ ters or own houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel this need for protection , one can read at the rush which is given to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily open a second home .
assistance Doc@@ tors Stri@@ ke : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new labour disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to allow more work for action starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers failed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persistent quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requ@@ esting official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating labour disputes starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year , the first overall cases in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , stating that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sli@@ pper@@ y , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if nothing had happened . &quot;
&quot; for me , his enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite . &quot;
but a sustainable cow eman@@ ating from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the dow@@ ning of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of being on the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
&quot; re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult , if not impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin was given the excuse of President Erdo@@ gan to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his office last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and char@@ ter@@ companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal approach to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , state television approved cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , as it is his reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for claiming that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he called for support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which has a deep @-@ rooted fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that feel viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West and now unite . &quot;
&quot; despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents were saying at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State should talk to each other again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s head of management , the R@@ BS board is only to be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan granted the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ user brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central head office and the stock exchange listing have to be changed to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private client business , which are received more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
&quot; during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire . &quot;
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I &apos;m saying that we don &apos;t pursue any global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own congregations and our employees will work among these brands with the clients .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , for how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can re @-@ launch these brands , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on a daily basis &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; following Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on something special
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career chances &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already collected 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners in the UK what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin firing staff Sergey Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin ordered the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) , that he was later Chief of the Head and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ a@@ ino recommended his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow dark .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once tou@@ red as a potential president once again wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - confi@@ de posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term since a third term of Putin viol@@ ated the constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken by another close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .

ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a villa@@ ger of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin Ba@@ in thinks it could be a sand a@@ ale with the 75 fish that were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que sides . &quot;
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering skill of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a g@@ ong for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents pioneering building and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower at the extension , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern bearing bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck &quot; to be alive
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jacket sounded at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; said the manager of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded when the boat was gut@@ ted by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has w@@ aged over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead he dis@@ member@@ ed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes .
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed her sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , they met the ex @-@ partner of the man . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschwei@@ ger favorable apartments ?
&quot; the SPD and the Green Party say , &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors should be taken more seriously in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Home for Action &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot;
but argument is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a rule is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable housing can also be found in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed shall provide incentives .
&quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even har@@ dest conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , Brat@@ mann said , ag@@ grav@@ ating the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do we compensate for the loss of further 1,@@ 300 favorable apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; because in the west @-@ city , deadlines are running at the end of the year . &quot;
some 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West Bank is increased drastically , one is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few city districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go to the boat for a broad majority . &quot;
&quot; indeed , they have focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family houses . &quot;
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside , rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been compla@@ ined by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on the television , then on video games and last limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon , playing cards , and other spin @-@ offs were created ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest fell slightly before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the server .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon , which will be tra@@ cked with a GPS , and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 3@@ 5.000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because lots of public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; whoever is doing sports on a regular basis , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also gr@@ ump@@ y game per@@ ni@@ ers , which always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it like ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphones apps like Fit@@ bit could follow up our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; because of poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday , 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast inv@@ aded the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ team A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ sts Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the suspended beam during the single @-@ day campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ championship title and holds the fifth as she soli@@ di@@ fies her call to be the best of her generation , or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ e has dominated her sport for the past three years , winning 15 med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u ba@@ il@@ out said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was expected to take a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between the balance and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in each women &apos;s multi @-@ battle group at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man trained was transformed into force .
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she hasn &apos;t lost any competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was guided by two turns , the picture was mu@@ ddy . &quot;
Swedish Be@@ ams and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ e holds the World Championship title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ be beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her ground exercise , she over@@ powered the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer while listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people killed seven people in h@@ is@@ panic dwell@@ ings within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which consisted of an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ qui@@ ties Ed@@ mund has a micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with a help aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- says she . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; severe ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause to ba@@ il@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected the whole Saturday with more rain falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards stated that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone demanded ten thousand Sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is widely used in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , all lik@@ el@@ ihood will reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 that was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still attacked people from flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ves on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ cked and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said to Hans@@ ford , that in the 48 years she lived there , she never had seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; spread quickly , &quot; as there were still severe ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer contacted Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rain and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a loss of instruction in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate EM@@ L reported that a con@@ sul in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa received 200 flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , r@@ ins@@ ed by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to accommodate the evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags provided for the residents to take the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday as flooded , but on Friday no reports have been reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ber , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; blown out by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was hospit@@ alized during his transportation . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was sm@@ ashed by balls , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z told the radio station . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared with the radio that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; three men were also shot , two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the station . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just investigated whether the injured man could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several guns .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ amed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a constant struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police inspec@@ tor Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no ar@@ rests and the police currently reviews the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ia ship in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three female gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one of female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the peak of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ aro@@ unds all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , the last year is Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents , who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the communities au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gym training . &quot;
I founded my turn @-@ over foundation of 20 years ago .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable accommodation in Harlem for over 15,000 urban te@@ ens ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics to young people who have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; thanks to the hol@@ en of Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to get their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; resident doctors would like to organise more strikes , after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal &quot;
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors who voted for a vote refused to reject it . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plan had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
the first assistance physicians are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend endar@@ s in order to improve the care for periods of time .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out . &quot;
&quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks have met with the government on the contrary , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t made over the last month that his door would always be open .
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the vibration and address the worries of the assistance physicians .
&quot; if he does not do so , the doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the stri@@ k@@ po@@ ste chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work @-@ fighting measures achieve nothing but little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance physicians and responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training programs , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training programs , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training programs , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ancies and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May . &quot;

&quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people receive a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots loose , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another heart attack .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture raises election fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being know@@ ingly ignored like a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les is verb@@ ally attacking the police , election observers and town@@ houses for ignor@@ ing proof of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption officer , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral cabins in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have an identification with them in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er merely needs to name his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also aims to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a Special Elec@@ toral Court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ ne Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric declared that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; evidence has been established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; prejudi@@ ces regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists work on station@@ ery documents to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot;
the report commissioned by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing to vote .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
to carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists complete full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ outs around election stations .
a change of law which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( People &apos;s Rights Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters are alone in the poll@@ ing cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s case no penalty was placed .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; of the election regi@@ strations of the town hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles from Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are advised by French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , besides the border and the band , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by far not the only athlete who has gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you can believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic med@@ als featuring more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street star un@@ cann@@ ily resembles . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see any simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy der Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess that is a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared for years with the G@@ le@@ e star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress
&quot; another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ wig , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal floating in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
&quot; theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like a pig died

&quot; the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ater &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style floating squ@@ ad@@ ron .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard to the team of the C@@ BS team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went down like a low , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for that .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming relay 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada re@@ acted fast online after they were shocked by the sound and speech
&quot; says Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han of China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the affili@@ ation , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was fast and hard , in which many were talking about him &quot;
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a floating performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we &apos;re sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end for 90 times in the people who responded to the notice on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to excuse himself in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly to our viewers and our fo@@ als in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the mission and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ sion , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no mi@@ str@@ ust was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try out under@@ pants .
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of signatures in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the pants before she put it back on the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; she came back and went out of business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own trun@@ ks and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants , which obviously didn &apos;t like her , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything .
she didn &apos;t seem to be bot@@ her@@ ed by anyone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the pants that she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman took her and pulled out and did not wash her .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn off the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approached from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knees in the skir@@ ts and twist while the attack@@ er is bent against pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; in the case of attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip until they move backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ uts his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of a serious examination - by le@@ asing some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot up his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a shower cap of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before le@@ aking each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ itting the sink of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the advancement of gut bacteria and their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked off , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known for testing the resistance of his bow@@ els by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to stations to flush @-@ flush toilets , the task has defini@@ tively put its immune system under a test &quot;
&quot; in the film , he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their lumin@@ ous number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t dock here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; senior vice president for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have liked to lick some of the things I have reli@@ ed upon him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult .
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 % said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , garbage was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ des and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was in June an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing reloc@@ ated her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the community house
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give some consol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung on the floor . &quot;
workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after she had found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ by who died in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will be les@@ bians that don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists pan@@ i@@ cked in Portugal after an eff@@ emin@@ ent military jet over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of Air Force deployed an unbelievable crash
&quot; the Air Force stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no risk of safety &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after an open jet crashing through a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up , understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ ent@@ schla@@ ger , without first seeing what came through the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet flew a little deeper than usual , but the Air Force insisted that security was at no time com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; land fires destroyed this summer part of the Portuguese mainland , with four people coming to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his sight . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ nut@@ winner must renoun@@ ce his domin@@ ance with the under@@ laid cup@@ board champion and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who , with Brazil , den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; in the course of training , the German suffered a change in b@@ anding in the knee , with which Bar@@ ca was at least initially cleared in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique had so far renoun@@ ced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other cont@@ est@@ ants took advantage of it . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is no doubt about the fitness level of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at the 3 : 2 in Pro@@ verb@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really did not really convince . &quot;
&quot; Sevilla , in turn , has continued to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ b 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; this brings the World Ranking first to the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would catch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and the time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they with@@ drew from the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ é@@ g@@ és on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang was said to be logical . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists took part in the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ il@@ ateral one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma really had to fight only in the first sentence . &quot;
&quot; after that , he determined the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang since only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the unexpected ro@@ using match did not evolve . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , enough stunning ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ dian won the bronze match against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had drawn up a rib@@ bed injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately , &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have become Olympic @-@ Vi@@ ckers in the same high table tennis . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; massive problems &quot; in the campaign
the leadership of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditionally conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Repub@@ lican strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire reported such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have vast problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media campaign . &quot;
Repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah usually is a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey carried out by the US of June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common to Repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes no difference , as &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , Tr@@ ump has threatened to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress would be more powerful than the arms . &quot;
Olympic : triple sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s Ath@@ lete is threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; following a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately shared a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the K@@ eni@@ as team leader by the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigation by an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and acted as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , submitted and signed the trial , &quot; stated K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup fourth in 2015 more than 800 meters .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan track leader Michael Rot@@ ich was pulled off from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; after numerous dop@@ ing attempts at the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation for a longer period of time . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with WA@@ DA &apos;s rules . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been systematically dop@@ ed in a comprehensive and systematic way . &quot;
Russian athletes were then expelled from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she remembered her love with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is up @-@ to @-@ date for the West Side Story : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ pp@@ ans went to New York and the New Yor@@ kers did not want it . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London scho@@ oner who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the attorney Tas@@ ne@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the bel@@ lied country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from making this decision ever , &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and became a widow in a few months . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay in the Supreme Court in case of election victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ idential candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its appointment by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next President will appoint the successor to Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
a narr@@ ator from Rei@@ d said later that he hadn &apos;t talked to Clinton yet if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be the lack@@ eys and auxili@@ aries of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants to be a neck @-@ calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nu@@ g magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys was different since &quot; Play@@ boy was for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; we have to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classic nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally with open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass avoid@@ ance
&quot; who doesn &apos;t suit and Erdo@@ gan is pra@@ ising , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ ds in Germany reck@@ on short @-@ term with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the exile Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal acts several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks came to the fore . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the head of the association compla@@ ined the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
this will allow Erdo@@ gan to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Association demanded that the Federal Government positions itself &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its adher@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a witch @-@ hunt against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critic is taking place . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who don &apos;t fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sa@@ ig@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper , calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks made the largest group of asylum seekers recognised in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus almost 29 per cent of all eligible candidates ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because it &apos;s not so stupid as to date : summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - that bites . &quot;
the locals who want to be convinced by the bal@@ lot fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so you are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and end voices only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the voting and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let go of election campaigns almost by the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s . &quot;
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tions .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Soul @-@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel will blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is in the Nor@@ theast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaign situations on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also realized that in the country , you crum@@ bled the base so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner co@@ king to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats recently met 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at election 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need , and largely move their campaign against the Internet . &quot;
&quot; online Elec@@ toral Camp@@ a@@ ign , &quot; it calls the chairman of the country , Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on the search for local voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just wa@@ its with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; a holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end at 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty well , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; there is also a praise for the decision of those responsible for the construction of the building , for example when it comes to furnishing houses . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site had moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the temporary traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sne@@ aks were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas fran@@ ch@@ ised .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ writing , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been sp@@ las@@ hed .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales break@@ through@@ s in them , everyone you ask is scrut@@ ini@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily traffi@@ cked are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; the sales revenue is based on &quot; &quot; over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
street renovation took off its operation &quot; two years ago . &quot;
he has to release half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner asked whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint answered , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other land circles , where so much more generous has been handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t travel , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the renovation work , he has no doubt that his master clip will be back at the end of the renovation work . &quot;
&quot; despite crises with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant experienced in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
six months of construction work is already brutal .
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being scre@@ wed into laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
&quot; other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was placed on results and led to a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the crack enco@@ ded communication , is not new . &quot;
nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and arms law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is starting a second trial for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ cks off the German passport with dual nationality . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he believes this to be reasonable and also requires nothing , which in the coalition partner has no chance anyway . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they partly have it : he plans fast procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally vulnerable .
some things work un@@ e@@ as@@ ingly and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patients for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it can &apos;t be said that the Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg assass@@ ins were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly employed , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election campaign times . &quot;
the inner safety has moved enormously .
&quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties , it went up high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ome dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the executive chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a rejection of dual nationality . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a departure from the double @-@ pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re @-@ open it is not useful .
&quot; and in the case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , has yet to be revealed . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could worry about stri@@ fe .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to defend itself on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk , saying , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen is still going through . &quot;
&quot; in spite of diesel sales , the distribution figures worldwide increase . &quot;
but it is not in all markets .
&quot; in the recall campaign , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts to conduct restra@@ int in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand , especially in Western Europe , weakened the total sales as reported by the company in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
sales director Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July particularly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there was a reluct@@ ance to buy back in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gases have escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of Nieder@@ sachsen is further deterior@@ ating by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition failure of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is recorded . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Chief Executive Officer Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales increase . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over , the motor@@ car station has a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in company trips . &quot;
reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models .
this would have confirmed VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA comprehen@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion , no deterioration will take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; for example , with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ le has resulted in uncertainty as to the possible guarantee regulations as it was called . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for criminal interest from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , managing director Josef Paul said : &quot; it is about 139 customers who park EUR 40 million on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers must &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay 0.4 per cent of the penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee is required for Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding € 100,000 to sight deposit or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he has been protecting 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another , and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent of the cost , &quot; said the chief executive officer . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now reduced . &quot;
&quot; to leave cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the chief executive officer . &quot;
most customers understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear them alone , &quot; economically , is not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some German banks have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal charges for deposits of three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay a comprehensive fee for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is endow@@ ed with wealth . &quot; &quot;
this can become a problem for a small bank if they keep money for free .
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the cooperative association of Bavaria , which charge a compensation for private clients deposits , &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and there is a threat of emig@@ ration from investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany won &apos;t be able to please this in the l@@ ati@@ tude .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually purchases records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ ger Men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ birth of records is not limited to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ghted between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it &apos;s also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and gra@@ zing wild@@ ly before I stand , hold my hands and say something special like : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic plate speci@@ als . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand close to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I &apos;m from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford , when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early se@@ ven@@ ties that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets will apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have led to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have conducted , people have generally dischar@@ ged themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record re@@ vocation of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers started the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that watch happy alignment memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally employ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff member moves from a stack of records . &quot;
&quot; a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people , who bought a record last month , have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men middle @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just recently came in here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ class . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the gram@@ ophone records , has a lower audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged teenagers . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the newest syn@@ th and sex @-@ packed pop music instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it &apos;s more like a shopping window than a big shopping mall .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I &apos;m giving the appearance to brave the jeans pants , I watch a group of young Teen@@ agers assem@@ bla@@ zing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops where persons inside the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes until En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a risk of fire and stability .
&quot; humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a judge in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people carrying out the 72 temporary deals , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camps rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite the Olympia disappointment : Martin remains comb@@ ative
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting show at the Olympic sailing season , Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to let himself be interrupted . &quot;

he did not have an explanation for his missing twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; to me it is frank@@ ly hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyse the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le in peace .

I will look at everything we have changed lately .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which are supposed to super@@ v@@ ise Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der very effectively . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at sever@@ ity points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary Tem@@ plates , there is often no need for infrastructure to provide a stationary speed heater to comply with speed limits . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for an un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans at time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ driven state , the trailer can be driven by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also sweat resistant outer cover disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also da@@ zzle with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
UK catches silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold catches
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance in the 7 @-@ day Ru@@ g@@ by was an ab@@ rupt halt to the last hur@@ dle in the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the strong defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t , that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ ji &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , former chief of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
&quot; eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this s@@ lag will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with another four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB scarcely touched the ball .
&quot; a prot@@ rac@@ ted torch of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a turned a touch down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the whi@@ stle and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed other weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still learn .
this is the way it is .
&quot; GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play by Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ phi@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and G@@ TC was sm@@ ashed cr@@ ushing into the lawn . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks up in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer to win a ru@@ dder win
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard P@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning at their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter unbe@@ aten use , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one was more assistant than the trainer who didn &apos;t know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes slightly the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge but that makes it an even bigger one .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ breaking morning to talk something more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked for , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked myself a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any races over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to finish , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much to reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take time for a year before making decisions about their future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary care provided for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was named in the original on a contribution by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
&quot; little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia di@@ gni@@ fied the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; was regarded as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who worked for 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , is 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 villages and villages with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the parish church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ eben &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re @-@ acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and there have always been new additions , because water means drinking water and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she commen@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he has lived up to the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to reduce nit@@ rate from the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised the water atten@@ dant Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well construction and re@@ structure of the association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the pipe at the elevated tanks at church lou@@ der on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because it is possible to fill the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko deals openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;

&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;
&quot; but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago , however , has progres@@ sed well and now lives privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

rel@@ ational at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man fired at 10.@@ 45@@ am in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner and wounded them fat@@ ally .
&quot; the man called himself by us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and he was publicly tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brow@@ ned and has bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the man carries a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
he who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lü@@ beck at first did not want to provide information about the course or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say any more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens threatened by the industry out of green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; in the case of the release of the renewable energy environment in the existing plants for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the tough negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers , who use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption , to the cash register . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies . &quot;
but this will not be raised in the steel industry either .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
this will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand in China , the situation escal@@ ated further when the world &apos;s largest producer of products fell to the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies with price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged . &quot;
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at last , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; around 8@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced was now back to the second month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in order intake in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl , she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ me study she played the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good with her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and nur@@ ture social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures lo@@ osen up in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
anyone who regularly challenges his lungs is not so quickly out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der sen@@ iors &quot; organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening from songs to older people awak@@ ens a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also requires special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting itself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people , who live alone , do so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows by singing in a choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
so there are good reasons to start singing .
&quot; whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , advises L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of a suitable offer Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer insight into the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
you can also find many senior cho@@ irs through the internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask for help in the Internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males on scre@@ aming of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the cra@@ fting of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the male also did not leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ ch@@ ew of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster on lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ew of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a pack of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised additionally . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for conclu@@ sive evidence .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this capacity may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ dule reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver . &quot;
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , there is again an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas , Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the case of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government denied that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
football hasn &apos;t stopped even before football .
&quot; against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the Sü@@ ver living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is bl@@ amed by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
&quot; although the emergency situation imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , indeed , this does not affect the lives of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
&quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at cup winner &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially noticeable at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; the paper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him , &quot; He was the best in the place . &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Vic@@ tory @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; came up early in the European League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we have done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; at the time of the coup attempt at the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez was announced after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but to do this , the storm would have to be ready to renoun@@ ce around one third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man declared : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the subject of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing spar@@ row in front of the games , was mar@@ shy and fully bu@@ sted at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scene : with a laid @-@ up smile , she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a celeb@@ r@@ ity that she won &apos;t fetch gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ek storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here &apos;s an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time World Champion in 2010 had to clin@@ ch a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ on . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , defending the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship , was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the oral consumption and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favourite .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , stun@@ ned Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 year old is more than 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ dropping , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to submit Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championships because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games because of a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favourite was tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already been able to leave it again . &quot;
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Chor@@ on@@ also Austrian citizens are also affected , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong which was popular among tourists .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ echn@@ on on the south @-@ east coast claimed several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , but probably it is the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - although they have not been informed about the exact date and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves toward stability , economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revol@@ ting uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the ou@@ ter@@ most south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several state offices , the Federal Constitutional Court has also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ intenance of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith , or from the Middle East , are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement as well . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ ti @-@ del@@ usion &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - already observe the &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as he said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state authorities . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them with a you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
they would be Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ arten said , he did not know . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for a certain point . &quot;
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case - the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist .
&quot; the decisive factor is , therefore , whether such persons influence the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the substantial increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and asylum seekers , Ma@@ fia said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee trage@@ dies or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; a nationwide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is , however , not recognis@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who had not appeared in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in asylum lod@@ gings have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left who have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic champi@@ ons or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that at times it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not straight athletic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is still participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
&quot; since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ t just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick names quickly made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the whale . &quot;
&quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made fun of it . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ meter fre@@ estyle , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the course of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone in a run@@ way over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before the Olympic and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop on the New Place has been co@@ al@@ ded .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back the next morning at 8 : 15 PM , the cash desk had disappeared for about 250 Euro . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t look so close to the lo@@ oming electoral defeat
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; the Repub@@ lican candidate told CN@@ BC in a telephone interview . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
mail climbs into trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric @-@ delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; soon , the corporation wants to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; we want to go to third parties for sale , &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether they will be delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always re @-@ en@@ quiries , such as by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and a shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we can change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company leadership the world &apos;s number five in the industry faces a new start .
&quot; at the end of the year , G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board intends to leave the company . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , has already been out of the supervisory body with effect on 12 September . &quot;
&quot; the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , Member of the Board of Management , already announced the management of the board as of September 1 , sharing the company with them . &quot;
&quot; he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted to name a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; in the future , anyone who will lead the market research company is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment on the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago would have been great . &quot;
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruit of the restructuring , however , has not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholder will at some point be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , this would also make the odds &quot; , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company had not been able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million were shr@@ inking by 3.4 percent . &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into dit@@ ches in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ Hör@@ n : eight injured
&quot; in an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ aus@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her data , according to an opposing vice , who , in part , drove on the return journey . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the place of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the injured trav@@ eller was brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ aus@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter eff@@ lu@@ ent will be € 3.@@ 44 for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare from October 1 , 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charges will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ hau@@ led calculation , the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; like mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that Unter@@ cover@@ ungen were used for these se@@ wer systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to take a deeper look into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous period of calculation should also be offset . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt explained the serious charges of charges against relatively small facilities with a very low sewage inf@@ low , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to the age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expendi@@ tures in all three systems , in the back @-@ up calculation period , there was a considerable increase in the amount of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt demonstrated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on account of damage in the Az@@ ores se@@ wer system .
&quot; after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage plant had to be extended , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low water san@@ itation in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance were completely sm@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water facilities has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned installations will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since it is possible to extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association in order not to extend these facilities because it is a deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; free time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat tells that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ riv@@ alled , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ gi@@ vings get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past when they were charged that the app black@@ face would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users , who gave them sl@@ otted holes , false teeth and abandoned che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; Yellow @-@ face &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es indicate a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote in an e @-@ mail , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and the least unpleasant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ si@@ ghted , but that the yellow @-@ face was pulled into the rej@@ ecting extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift .
&quot; American culture seems to be ent@@ angled in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - which in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel officer who concentrated on sub@@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; for their part , Z@@ hu said that she will leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership distor@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects committee of Congress &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site .
&quot; the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican members of the Conf@@ lic@@ t Com@@ mittees , Intelligence Com@@ mittees and Military Commission Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their app@@ rais@@ als to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ sus , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information that were typically be@@ wit@@ ched by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their alle@@ gations , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com person publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ es could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command headed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they were granted that analysts were concerned with the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are under investigation by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican task force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; embarrass@@ ed the moral under analy@@ st and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little room for differing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no evidence of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was taken up by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was ongoing . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes over more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush intended only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , according to government agencies , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker confirmed that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State did not have any significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge , however , was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in the Central Command .
&quot; the USA wins fourth match in the field Ho@@ ckey of Women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after having fired three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember what ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising whi@@ r@@ l through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time with three years ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , where everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things for better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working environment in London that we now have .
we can pull the ru@@ dder completely around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door @-@ row in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; surrounded by the rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is passed from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
&quot; you can &apos;t switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the queue without talking about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ opol@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among those known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event alike .
&quot; sports that are not generally recognized : air guns , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast and may it be for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ se that many who , I had asked , did not know that it was an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans that for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider @-@ character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dedicated enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ to @-@ ending up@@ stream - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram , they are rated according to the performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but in the television transmission also another high goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel as a little tired when watching these games .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly up again . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner suggested recently according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base after air . &quot;
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of protests during the clas@@ hes with the police were killed while shooting .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the depths of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Asia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stran@@ gle@@ hold with regard to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely @-@ critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o liber@@ ators front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des that have been more or less enforced in recent years to exploit the tur@@ mo@@ il and to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ de after years of hardness under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , thri@@ ve in politics and economics , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is changing as well .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was prime minister to Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tic genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested against elections , seemingly bot@@ her@@ ed by the government and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mis@@ e of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters interven@@ ed in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an town , headed by Tig@@ ray and hatred against the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests of the United States and other Western allies are in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to clearly support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump states his asser@@ tion Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who seek to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after making the announcement at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump called back on the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alle@@ gation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate wanted none of it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism boun@@ ces down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic fron@@ tiers in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an et@@ ched note since his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is rein@@ forcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ster Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ ump , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s asser@@ tions about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , serving as the Secretary of State Clinton as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being taken over against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , twi@@ light &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ t &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once sold over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cosy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were disp@@ at@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; soap made in the summer of 2014 , So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people took it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ins wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , it &apos;s also a re @-@ finding . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time associate of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural rice bowls .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by Pri@@ zes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she had gone to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that pleased me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the club in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took up the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owner of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ w with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s ter@@ rap@@ in soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; tra@@ ded Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , cor@@ ked snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of the IP@@ O in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered min@@ ce , this found the couple to discuss the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marked the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ own was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food rem@@ nants , &quot; Ziegel@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar compounds were tried out , since calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome cuisine . &quot;
&quot; while resear@@ ching the book that includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , budget@@ ary management - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - such as the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping politicians &quot; and the challenge of transforming p@@ amp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
&quot; especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Food pose . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ man @-@ man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine , like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper , with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt , caused the White House to produce the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple gave the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; She really made people sick . &quot;
there was the storm @-@ bag incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a bad trick to miss a modest name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped a little bit reluct@@ antly in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it did not taste bad .

killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the line to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved lives of almost 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives in the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian contractor who showed him during an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; he has never seen himself as a hero , he said , according to the picture : &quot; for me it is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children can &apos;t play with it , &quot; says the picture his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ ral animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in the winter .
&quot; after an examination on board the S@@ anna research ship , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are born only with 150 years offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swim along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is average barely 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal speeds up to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent solution for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland hair would become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland h@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland hair .
&quot; their slow @-@ motion @-@ pent@@ emp@@ o was , as they were able to equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ment out from higher water layers . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ h@@ ie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest size of 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland h@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular @-@ core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously permits at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eses live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , where a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip was stuck on the neck , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us @-@ flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
the volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal bites heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on as soon as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; in the most recent meeting , the municipal council has focuss@@ ed on topics related to building . &quot;
the panel was facilit@@ ated by the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential space can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ enting and closing issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be made , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and ru@@ de sen@@ iors in the same way .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ willing can now report to the town hall as of now , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also have en@@ quiries about the establishment of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created land usage plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; for example , the industrial zone , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 in the Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n area . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W compet@@ ency field and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary funds will continue to operate from London in financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval in the UK has been enough for them so far . &quot;
large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; lobby association expects 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk category . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg is home to a big fund industry , but as well as Dublin fails to cut the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company &apos;s consulting firm Mer@@ cer , the city stands on seventh place , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial center for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the balance of forces also speaks : in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

a U.S. At@@ tor@@ ney decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc. .
&quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the cost that arose during the defense of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say they have returned full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb@@ ust after the extract of the remaining group of fighters , who have buried within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the comb@@ at@@ ants , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS . &quot;

&quot; Clinton &apos;s € 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary Bill Clinton delivered an income of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim spa@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns for the past ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false speeches and rein@@ for@@ cements in terms of his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for their refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before the tax inspections did not complete . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump Cri@@ tics , among others , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise money , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business , and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed into the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump ur@@ ges to publish his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the subject during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate took his seat here , called Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; from the voters and not the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2015 Clin@@ tons tax declaration , this only applies to USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index Fund , from which the Clinton Divi@@ den@@ ds and Ear@@ nings contributed $ 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ ft , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ m .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already had the idea years ago , has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; Friday is World Mobile Day , dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; when he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chicken cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with soil , a con@@ dom is packed together with a fire@@ work body , whose end is twisted to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air . &quot;
a hint is usually enough to hunt the elephant .
&quot; a last chance is a laun@@ cher , who shoots a fire@@ works fire@@ work into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no new building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

&quot; the City Council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales ski@@ os@@ ks at the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bel@@ fry . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT news
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media stir after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as Arab guests had requested &quot; an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; published his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there &quot; sho@@ wered him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels management . &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation is required .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , where people called the whole a scandal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given up the alleged &quot; demands for Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; she said in another post stating that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly referred to all alle@@ gations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; view &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction to not include Israel in the Quick Selec@@ ting List , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police puts tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ let against prot@@ esters Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the use of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters considered gra@@ ff@@ iti to spray against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
Russia &amp; Iran trade suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade summary between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , interest on the part of Russian companies has grown strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador announced . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing ties with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade summary between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in comparison to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is celebrating a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian representation made about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily the travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d visiting monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y was carried out on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun , three dark @-@ dressed persons , who had m@@ ashed their faces , demanded the publication of cash from the drink market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the transfer , the perpetr@@ ators have to travel towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and had to flee from the gravel car park situated opposite the car park entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; whoever has made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet area , Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ save with the visit of the pet@@ ri@@ fied zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was delighted with the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swim and pl@@ under . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their own prepared corpor@@ e@@ as such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; workshops were designed , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ s@@ lei@@ gh ride of all the stran@@ ts in the next two years , the Senior Minist@@ erial Round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern , went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the crosses and issued the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady stood and so the pilgri@@ m went from the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; each day and evening the individual day tours were framed by a short pulse with different prayers , songs and text texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is stopped at field cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches time and again to sing a song from specially assembled pilgri@@ m songs . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the parish church of the local par@@ ishes was available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , one took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but first had to save some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers in the warm @-@ up heat and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
&quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing clo@@ ister church of St. Peter , it passed the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , Min@@ is arrived in the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God thank@@ ed God .
&quot; at the evening mass in the cathedral , the Min@@ is arrived at the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s aim were welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home as Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . the yo@@ ke made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to cover a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they only got a modest sixth place at the London rail world championships in London . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
his retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won Ho@@ y 4 years ago - and Sk@@ inner won an olymp@@ ic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was running short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation going into a higher gear in order to slow it down and to enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said , &quot; It is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic Port and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , he admitted that after a weak start he pur@@ pos@@ ely fell on the track . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would mean Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - would mean a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will be focused on safety .
&quot; he had argued with officials before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ a , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record Time took place in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a raft of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary account of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing kill@@ ings as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melt @-@ making of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium sm@@ elter in Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts as the supplying energy company communic@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , not to give any further subsi@@ dy to the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy specified for 20 years runs in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk during closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt @-@ making process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melt @-@ melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses cash and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and la@@ stly due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts has already been amor@@ ti@@ zed in its annual subscription to the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year even if there is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consum@@ es about 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; that wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the sought after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , fragmented reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ Un@@ cle and Produc@@ ers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ m action of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this publicity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most sold edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the journal are still pun@@ ched before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even though everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success is not pleasing to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but h@@ opping around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to be passing by .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal councils have 160@@ ,000 people a year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s most emergency number is rejected each year by the municipal councils , while the industry anticip@@ ates the effects of other short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell convention centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centre Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only get worse without the suspension of the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s congreg@@ ational centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with inv@@ inci@@ ble and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been fired by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of homeless people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Court of Justice and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal councils and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly took weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after her announcement that , in February , her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a gun on an employee while in February in a Je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , submitted on Wednesday at the Charlotte County Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i gave up for months to have been waiting for the matter to be regulated internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , dra@@ gged a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vincent &apos;s knee , &quot; said Ben@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; said Ben@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
the prosecution came only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate provoked a rebellion when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ men and weapons - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was to elect and appoint judges .
&quot; Tr@@ ump@@ tional Camp@@ a@@ ign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context , and that he would not inc@@ ur violence . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ is complaint requests damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence , and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage . &quot;
hope Hi@@ cks was not able to comment on Tr@@ ump Press Spo@@ kes@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks .
attempts to contact Philip did likewise fail .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; calls for his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , were not re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has led a controversial campaign . &quot;
&quot; the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President , Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : elections in front of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally short of the CD@@ U , which could again come to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were returning to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of light losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD according to the survey , according to the survey , only amounted to 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they were still lying behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 per cent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; in contrast to 2011 , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return with 5 percent . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia communic@@ ator was on the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet era . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser , even if tor@@ mented slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the cell phone could be folded similarly to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile spar@@ row experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , suppliers are domin@@ ating the market , all of which came later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone in the meantime .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was just beginning in 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen is easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; after all , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to om@@ it the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we run a lot of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefit from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming at the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
like the Olympics He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in atmospheric growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as back up our future business and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Dei@@ gh@@ ton is the Chairman of He@@ ath@@ row Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treas@@ ury .
&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , companies who earn money with online advertising are trying to b@@ ypass an ad block , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ gger in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding for his advertisements to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of what part of the page advertisement is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth battle between the all@@ otted open source community and the hang@@ ers has been underway since the invention of indicator lights , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has , apart from advertising blocks on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile apps for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment of such a step .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over it targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block contents on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; announced a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control over people &apos;s hands . &quot;
to over@@ ride woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman in the dark said &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police told in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill herself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said , calling on them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing following a man crossing and killing a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street .
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way - and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable once in the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have rejected earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus increases its daily rate of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet scientists .
&quot; although it was once hab@@ itable , Venus -- over several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
its oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned out by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and introduced too little co @-@ determination to the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President and General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season Roy , Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league in the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the league . &quot;
&quot; he took the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post season in each of the two last years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy had four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ v workers resume talks , strike on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles concerning wages for the North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties are sitting on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group service provider were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the stri@@ pping process of the current dispute , &quot; says a joint statement . &quot;
we will hold a few full day sessions in the next few weeks starting next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 per cent as a result of negative market pressures . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore sub@@ contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell dismissed tens of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lined its operations as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision to leave the European Union in June . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ aden star cluster .
&quot; the new data helps astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve around different rates in the star cluster , as well as in which connection rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary formation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star@@ ters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning to the quick@@ est .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars reach large quantities of star @-@ winds . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the P@@ lei@@ ades Ballet , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their ro@@ aming rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades rot@@ ational rates that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star res@@ ig@@ ns
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded to him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ ves , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed several mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be accepted in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eball . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the pla@@ za .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; admitted that ster@@ oids were banned between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received effective funds for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends won the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy and sympathy from the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can &apos;t start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a learned athlete had won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions , these news come to an end . &quot;
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was proven which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
he requested the opening of the B @-@ Probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio , the news reached the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; the athle@@ tics said . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to be the banned substance of the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly announced criticism of the athlete &apos;s speech .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny taking , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , including the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming , the former off@@ ences in China also ensured violent clas@@ hes between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ les purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ tou@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested positively by the Chinese championships in 2014 on the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; data c@@ law : h@@ acker , as per@@ fi@@ de , black@@ mail her ran@@ som &quot;
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware effectively attack companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware crew specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 businesses in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize heavily on attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ mailing is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to corporate att@@ un@@ ctions was frigh@@ ten@@ ingly fast over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mailing .
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies deal with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware is added . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals already suffered from attacks whose patients could be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay will get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in view of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; the hack@@ ers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate heavily and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four people . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular box to the actual black@@ boards .
&quot; the malware kits originated by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids are then looking for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not enough threat to successful retri@@ eval , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could , in future , take entirely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Def@@ con min@@ er conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , just the top of the cockpit is slightly different . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; not only is a trunk of 4@@ 53 l available at high @-@ height and 10@@ 26 l with folded back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair , providing storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; however , he is likely to make his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine power@@ ing : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because it ass@@ esses many obstacles in maneu@@ vering as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
&quot; and the intelligent speed control responds to traffic signs detection , and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required . &quot;
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , you will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with its HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) was only liable for any liability that is typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a knee injury .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer get paid ?
&quot; after their trip , sick leave only get money back when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their arrival . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
&quot; the family thought that the trip had been fla@@ wed , and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; before the court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment . &quot;
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among each other - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; after the violence done by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said many people worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and determined at the same time to respond to terrorist dangers .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and sch@@ ism . &quot;
we won &apos;t treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if a perpetr@@ ator would have to leave the country faster , this would raise the security and strengthen the consent of the people for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère intends to implement proposals to the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in the medium @-@ four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
video surveillance should be improved to am@@ end arms law so that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is more difficult .
the last widely discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to remain true to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession , how the danger of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister keeps a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot;
it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the dual nationality .
a general prohibition of full wear is not considered to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject and I lean the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
&quot; you can talk about rules , for example , in road traffic or for witnesses from court . &quot;
green leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the Minister that he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist acts of action and ability to act .
&quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay will no longer be safe for people in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ ews on the stra@@ pping street regularly - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who are driving in traffic on the road every evening in traffic jams , when driving through the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road building will extend the legal distance of 700 metres between Hammer Strasse and Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is divided up early , thus improving the overall procedure on the busy part of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district council of Münster @-@ West .
&quot; the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes drivers nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; on week@@ days , the return train reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
this is the reason why the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 is just before the exit of Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only rer@@ ou@@ ted via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge had no longer the necessary load capacity , in order to record the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ daily traffic jam is going to last , the relevant national company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to be expected , the bridge has an official waste @-@ time period until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal remedy esp@@ ace , Landes@@ betrieb confi@@ dently selected the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is likely to be expected . &quot;
traffic is passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; Das invisi@@ bly Haus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee background , to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule childhood school has visited a presentation of the prize @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Mu@@ en@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students visited the small house between eleven and 15 years old . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the press release of the Junge theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from english language , and the Junge theatres will work together during the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; between October and December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , drama and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ cker in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the spectacle of heaven , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one rolls around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you don &apos;t have to think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be various causes behind them , emphas@@ ising Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Dis@@ orders and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you mean by the way , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , so an entry and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; just falling asleep many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; this can include organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another illness . &quot;
&quot; very early w@@ aking is often common with a depression , &quot; says Weber . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
&quot; for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts thinking about everyday problems and worries . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired on the day , you should go to the doctor , advises Wo@@ eß . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , un@@ asleep , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphas@@ ises the lack of sleep doctors in Germany . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , advises Weber . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of sick day fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare yourself for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please don &apos;t make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the disgu@@ sting , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping @-@ end . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of jack@@ bolts on which you can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; she counts on : regular sleeping and standing @-@ up times , not to sleep too long , not to sleep on the day , not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and this is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appo@@ inting cut off of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he was awarded gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a , and at the same time made his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mate in the criticism standing by Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 Euros and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page during the night . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look exactly at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a certain time before WM / OS can be controlled by independent controllers from WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , the choice @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot;
airport : arrest warran@@ ts arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civilians of the Düsseldorf Police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
&quot; as a gang , the suspect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage theft . &quot;
&quot; around 9.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang , which was known to the police from the past th@@ ef@@ ts of theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the mid @-@ July of this year and , in doing so , proc@@ eeded very professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime investig@@ ator 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who have been travelling to Germany for the purpose of the crimes committed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in total , they carried over 15,000 Euros in total . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like this at first glance , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes some play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
someone spra@@ yed &quot; ugly ! &quot; on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; however , in recent weeks , articles about this &quot; trendy bor@@ ough , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will however prefer to be bil@@ led with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator Henkel has expressed itself repeatedly in favour of a hard action by the police against the project , design@@ ating the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ets , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , police pat@@ ro@@ led three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three man@@ ning cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers removed from the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain before late @-@ night . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who in majority regards police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police put on between house owners and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Riga River . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and choice ber@@ liner from all over the world over the last few years . residents from GDR times and former home owners now share their neighborhood with them . &quot;
this is also reflected in the rent that has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on dis@@ car@@ ded disks or newly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags . &quot;
no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; left @-@ wing violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal off@@ ences like bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes make material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated buildings . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is more important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for those who studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer moved consciously into the Riga Street - and stayed .
&quot; that is why it was so important that the residents get their streets back : from the police , politicians and the media , which all of a sudden claimed the interpretation of the city district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through thou@@ ght@@ less new buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they are con@@ dos which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so good here live here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws near should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a ta@@ vern , compla@@ ining badly about noise there . &quot;
all people presented with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Council for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugees , administration , public authorities , and anyone else involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; thus , some - less mo@@ cking than they had on the large number of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; a management professional with a talent for languages and people was sought , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administration work is not the central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all about organizing , working with people on @-@ site and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on a period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ orable and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be in the Was@@ hin@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the Municip@@ ality and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been quite difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far it does not work , if you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be rec@@ tified , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be erected in the Was@@ hin@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be gut@@ ted or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here , there is administration and honorary official . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also problem cases , &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; People with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : are they afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer quite clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ vely . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins bring them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; in other words , the main and honorary official must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they have always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid . &quot;
actually it is unfair to place them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customers also make it clear that they are already working at the same time to sensi@@ bly integrate the existing people .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar search for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 P.@@ M. in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
&quot; the people surprised the two , and struck the b@@ low@@ ds in their escape . &quot;
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; as a result , the police filed several stri@@ pe occup@@ ations as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag was un@@ successful .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell short of the apartment or their flight . &quot;
