<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 year old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid of sport" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the forage troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he was not even photographing for photography."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sporting help handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the golden pyramid of sports.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, champions-tour-player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of sports.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting young talents."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the participants include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giver, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the jumping horse Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company wandered into the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Award went."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential candidates, however, are not at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt small and cautions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the contrary, would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively go back regulators, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost verbally."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate cancels the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be some party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in protected areas; it wants to announce the Parisian climate protection treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly strengthen the renewable energies with its investment program:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says," The minimum wage must be rushed, "he says, he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics believe him, that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every escaped woman experiences sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is an almost everyday occurrence for women who flee their own lives.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled briefly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a supporter of social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons outweigh the escape:" many secretly steal away from it, because they do not see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the fact that tugboats for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who thinks that end as soon as they arrive in Germany, Bahr recalls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the Munich north are traumatised, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily born.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations only for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether or not they knew from a similar project as in Munich, some say no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabians, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Lower Franconia there are storeys in some common shelters or own houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together, there can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel this need for protection, one can read at the rush which is given to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily open a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new labour disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to allow more work for action starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers failed to address the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistent quiet "to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requesting official re-negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labour disputes starting at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year, the first overall cases in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the leader of the BMA assistance doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms, which had been recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 54,000 assistance physicians and medical students, stating that the contract should be advantageous and accepted."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter-player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be slippery, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for me, his enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable cow emanating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of being on the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"rebuilding the cousins will be difficult, if not impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin was given the excuse of President Erdogan to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his office last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and chartercompanies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal approach to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, state television approved cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, as it is his reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued resentment of the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for claiming that after the attempted coup d'état he called for support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an" alliance of outsiders, "as an analyst once described to me: two countries that feel violated and badly treated by the West and now unite."</seg>
<seg id="42">"despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were saying at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin chose to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should talk to each other again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian), that he was later Chief of the Head and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your trust." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the main task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow dark.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once toured as a potential president once again wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - confide posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term since a third term of Putin violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Crossing: bridge now connected with Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique sides."</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering skill of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a gong for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the shutter represents pioneering building and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower at the extension, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern bearing bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances on which the team worked, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the SPD and the Green Party say," "Investors should be taken more seriously in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "Home for Action" "at the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A rule is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favorable housing can also be found in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, as Bratmann says:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed shall provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, said Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even hardest conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, Bratmann said, aggravating the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do we compensate for the loss of further 1,300 favorable apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the west-city, deadlines are running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West Bank is increased drastically, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social-weak in just a few city districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside, rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on the television, then on video games and last limited to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon, playing cards, and other spin-offs were created)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest fell slightly before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overburdened the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokemon, which will be tracked with a GPS, and once they have been found" "photographed" "(about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "hit deaf ears because lots of public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"whoever is doing sports on a regular basis, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also grumpy game perniers, which always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphones apps like Fitbit could follow up our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because of poker's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympia ship in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the catholic is round, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one of female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the threefold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the peak of this sport, but we do not see turnarounds all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team. furthermore, the last year is Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gyms that are maintained by parents, who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the communities aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gym training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turn-over foundation of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"for my events, we have offered free and affordable accommodation in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teens (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "thanks to the holen of Olympic team golds and thanks, her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to get their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture raises election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from the office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored like a crushing government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police, election observers and townhouses for ignoring proof of electoral abuse due to" "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption officer, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have an identification with them in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter merely needs to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandals in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a Special Electoral Court decided that the incumbent mayor Lutne Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" in cynical fashion, "and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic allegations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric declared that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm to the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading ID cards to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "evidence has been established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of "politically correct" prejudices regarding ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists work on stationery documents to stop" reaping. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The report commissioned by Theresa May also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing to vote.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">To carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications to an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists complete full post-elections and envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up shut-outs around election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law which facilitated an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act (People's Rights Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photographing in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training in order to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters are alone in the polling cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets's case no penalty was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unfit," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check-ups" of the election registrations of the town hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn off the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approached from behind, you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knees in the skirts and twist while the attacker is bent against pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip until they move backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shuts his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and Würgereflex of a serious examination - by leasing some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot up his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a shower cap of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leitting the sink of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the advancement of gut bacteria and their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he licked off, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his bowels by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to stations to flush-flush toilets, the task has definitively put its immune system under a test"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their luminous number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't dock here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstormings that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have liked to lick some of the things I have relied upon him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58% said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social apartment after a Delogiation with a damage of £50,000, because they had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya skeldon and their partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls showed gaping holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strides and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was in June an arrangement for antisocial behavior."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing relocated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogians were cheered by lightened neighbors who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one of them said," "They didn't care for anybody."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now that they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogiation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be awful for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some consolation to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">"a dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Delogierung on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after she had found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skelby who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will be lesbians that don't stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall told that the Delogiation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"who doesn't suit and Erdogan is praising, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurds in Germany reckon short-term with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it might even be" "some hundred thousand", "believes the president of the exile Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurds municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already outstripped Kurdish strongholds with criminal acts several months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the deceiving putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks came to the fore."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that assimilates refugees, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the association complained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">This will allow Erdogan to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because it's not so stupid as to date: summer holidays, heat and land election campaigns - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who want to be convinced by the ballot fighters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so you are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and end voices only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the voting and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let go of election campaigns almost by the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Soul-ering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel will blame for the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create that" "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's federal election circuit is in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost CDU largely waives the usual election campaign situations on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also realized that in the country, you crumbled the base so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly exists in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU campaigner coking to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is much on the game, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats recently met 22 percent behind CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at election 2011, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">"they make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need, and largely move their campaign against the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="33">"online Electoral Campaign," it calls the chairman of the country, Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners embark on the search for local voters among the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just waits with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "a holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work which start at 5.30am in the morning and end at 8pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty well," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is also a praise for the decision of those responsible for the construction of the building, for example when it comes to furnishing houses."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site had moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The temporary traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many sneaks were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas franchised.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overwriting," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been splashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way at 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales breakthroughs in them, everyone you ask is scrutinizing."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer", "i.e. produced for other companies, have hardly any consequences for the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight drop", "but also admits that of course" "the mileage is missing." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily trafficked are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the sales revenue is based on" "over 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Street renovation took off its operation "two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt on a request from Göhner asked whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint answered, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Göhner knows from other land circles, where so much more generous has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't travel, it is also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"at the end of the renovation work, he has no doubt that his master clip will be back at the end of the renovation work."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant experienced in its long-term history."</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being screwed into laws."</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a Dulce status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the sergeant.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner," "says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package."</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overwhelm anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, as Minister of the Interior, he was placed on results and led to a" "achievable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some is already known, announced, announced, that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the crack encoded communication, is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and arms law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière is starting a second trial for proposals not to be made with the SPD: he wants to recruit sympathy for terrorist groups and knocks off the German passport with dual nationality."</seg>
<seg id="17">"that will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he believes this to be reasonable and also requires nothing, which in the coalition partner has no chance anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They partly have it: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things work uneasingly and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patients for example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it can't be said that the Ansbach and Wuerzburg assassins were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people profoundly employed, could not be cluttered even in election campaign times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety has moved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are elections."</seg>
<seg id="35">"on the subject of internal security, Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, between the two parties, it went up high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisome dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the executive chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a rejection of dual nationality."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't hold anything from a departure from the double-pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To re-open it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and in the case of a Burka ban, he had constitutional objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually" reasonable "for the coalition partner, has yet to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it that could worry about strife.</seg>
<seg id="45">"however, the SPD is also trying to defend itself on the subject of inner security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually purchases records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym Non-Allemonger Men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the rebirth of records is not limited to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresighted between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and grazing wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something special like:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent salesmen were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic plate specials."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand close to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I'm from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford, when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early seventies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets will apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who have heard about the comeback and have led to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have conducted, people have generally discharged themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record revocation of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that watch happy alignment memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally employ.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff member moves from a stack of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people, who bought a record last month, have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men middle-aged) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came in here and said," "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-class."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the gramophone records, has a lower audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged teenagers."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the newest synth and sex-packed pop music instead of experimental jazz groans from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but psychic traumas are hard to determine if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more like a shopping window than a big shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I'm giving the appearance to brave the jeans pants, I watch a group of young Teenagers assemblazing themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research has yielded that the results of YouGov match, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectibles, which exist in reality, record shops and online forums, are not considered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with bumblebees on Berwick Street and the sheets by plates while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator hanging over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops where persons inside the camp sell goods, cigarettes until Energydrinks, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a risk of fire and stability.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a judge in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 temporary deals, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely plausible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids" Café. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camps rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance in the 7-day Rugby was an abrupt halt to the last hurdle in the Fijis, when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the strong defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't, that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this slag will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with another four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he converted."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB scarcely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a protracted torch of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, in the seventh minute, Veremalua turned a touch down in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the whistle and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed other weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay by Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulphians, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GTC was smashed crushing into the lawn."</seg>

<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks up in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Pieve, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning at their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>

<seg id="8">He said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes slightly the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that is the right term in such circumstances."</seg>

<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>

<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked myself a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any races over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to finish, Stanning and Glover had too much to reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking for something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take time for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the industry out of green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the case of the release of the renewable energy environment in the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the tough negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers, who use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption, to the cash register."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this will not be raised in the steel industry either.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">This will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "explained IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, in view of the weakening domestic demand in China, the situation escalated further when the world's largest producer of products fell to the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies with price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have emerged."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at last, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"around 8,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a brief upliftment in May, the quantity produced was now back to the second month."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in order intake in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl, she was in school choir, in the Lehrame study she played the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good with her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and nurture social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures loosen up in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly challenges his lungs is not so quickly out of the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der seniors" organisations. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening from songs to older people awakens a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia are sinking to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head also requires special performance, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting itself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people, who live alone, do so not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">So there are good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">"whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of a suitable offer Seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer insight into the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many senior choirs through the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask for help in the Internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">"to their surprise, the male also did not leave the males cold - however, they behaved always the same in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of arousal of kittenbabys at the michew of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens screams differs with the urgency of their neediness."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight female kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">"they were played for a pack of little ones, taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger excited kittens, which were raised additionally."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for conclusive evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all the females, even those who had not yet their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," said Konerding. "</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the speaker when this reputations of the more excited kittens played off.</seg>
<seg id="16">This capacity may possibly be innate or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," said the biologist. "</seg>

<seg id="7">"Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, first exploded two bombs on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another man was killed, according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the seaside resort of Patong which was popular among tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban staff."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast, as well as in Chechnon on the south-east coast claimed several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it is the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist movement or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - although they have not been informed about the exact date and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailands king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary trips to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves toward stability, economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolting uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the outermost south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="19">"for constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the respective party - in this case - the AfD - changes its target direction by certain persons who are extremist.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic champions or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly obese swimmer from Ethiopia is so slow that at times it was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but it was rather his not straight athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media."</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old is still participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habt just wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nick names quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "roubles of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English boulevard" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "made fun of it."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the course of Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the buoyant from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to travel alone in a runway over 100 meters of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim before the Olympic and had never taken such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the sewage charges will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an overhauled calculation, the sewage plant in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"like mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was established that Untercoverungen were used for these sewer systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost-efficient manner."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the trade and industrial companies from Welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous period of calculation should also be offset."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt explained the serious charges of charges against relatively small facilities with a very low sewage inflow, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to the age of refurbishment and repair expenditures in all three systems, in the back-up calculation period, there was a considerable increase in the amount of refurbishment and repair expenses."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt demonstrated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on account of damage in the Azores sewer system.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage plant had to be extended, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that in the case of low water sanitation in the three plants, expenses for operation and maintenance were completely smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water facilities has been spared over the past 20 years."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat tells that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its Filtertool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unrivalled, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All misgivings get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past when they were charged that the app blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users, who gave them slotted holes, false teeth and abandoned cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "Yellow-face". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies indicate a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"grace Sparapani wrote in an e-mail, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was" "hurting and the least unpleasant". ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow-face was pulled into the rejecting extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be entangled in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - which in terms of race diverser than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user," it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the big part white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collaborators, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel officer who concentrated on subpresented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for their part, Zhu said that she will leave their Snapchat account and added," I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Conflict Committees, Intelligence Committees and Military Commission Commites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their appraisals to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, short Census, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information that were typically bewitched by high-level CentCom commanders regularly drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their allegations, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom person publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossules could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command headed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were granted that analysts were concerned with the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings, while the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, CentCom reports are under investigation by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," embarrassed the moral under analyst and "gave excessively little room for differing opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no evidence of the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which was taken up by CentCom analyst complaints."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was ongoing."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes over more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush intended only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, according to government agencies, the team headed by Mr. Hooker confirmed that the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State did not have any significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this knowledge, however, was not published, reported the Times in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time with three years (their two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things for better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working environment in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can pull the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door-row in the first half of the game with a backlash from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"surrounded by the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is passed from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leopoly or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among those known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">"sports that are not generally recognized: air guns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and may it be for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparse that many who, I had asked, did not know that it was an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider-character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dedicated enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-to-ending upstream - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiaprogram, they are rated according to the performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists need to go further up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but in the television transmission also another high goal: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as a little tired when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a respite."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base after air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protests during the clashes with the police were killed while shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the depths of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stranglehold with regard to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely-critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo liberators front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades that have been more or less enforced in recent years to exploit the turmoil and to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of hardness under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons the Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, thrive in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister to Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactic genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005 after thousands of protesters protested against elections, seemingly bothered by the government and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters intervened in Gondar, an amharan town, headed by Tigray and hatred against the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests of the United States and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump states his assertion Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his fellow combatants who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of declaring statements he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after making the announcement at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump called back on the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted none of it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bounces down on Mr. Trump while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" Of course, I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic frontiers in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction falls." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an etched note since his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is reinforcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumpster Scherze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trump, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trump's assertions about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called them backbiters, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, serving as the Secretary of State Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being taken over against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, twilight "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumpt's apology than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="7">"but when New York is changing, it's also a re-finding."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime associate of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like capers and sour onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by Prizes from Williamsburg," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client."</seg>

<seg id="36">"in fact, the owner of Soap Cherie offered a special soap for brew with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient."</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland's terrapin soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"its menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Suey" "traded Chinese cuisine in the USA, while bricks were told in their book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, corked snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the crash of the IPO in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered mince, this found the couple to discuss the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years prior to the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marked the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the Cockaigne."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense issue," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new Budgetown was equally tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a" wonderful way to recycle food remnants, "Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar compounds were tried out, since calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholesome cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="27">"while researching the book that includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the utility recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, budgetary management - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - such as the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeeping politicians "and the challenge of transforming pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"especially tasty are the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake-Food pose."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant-house kitchen of his kitchen, he fed as the million-man-man of the world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, a housekeeper, with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt, caused the White House to produce the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebral animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an examination on board the Sanna research ship, this shark was allowed to return to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks are born only with 150 years offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark swim along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is average barely 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five meter long animal speeds up to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent solution for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland hair would become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland harks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-motion-pentempo was, as they were able to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadavers, which torment out from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Grönlandhie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest size of 502 centimetres was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland harks had normal carbon-14-amounts in their lenticular-core, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase obviously permits at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleses live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, where a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck on the neck, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus-flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal bites heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on as soon as possible as many descendants as possible," "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein."</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the city on the Main, therefore, has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW competency field and real estate markets. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether monetary funds will continue to operate from London in financial transactions across the EU."</seg>

<seg id="10">"while in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"Luxembourg is home to a big fund industry, but as well as Dublin fails to cut the infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in addition, the rent for first-class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime."</seg>

<seg id="2">The registrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the period up to the next Romsleigh ride of all the strants in the next two years, the Senior Ministerial Round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, went on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the crosses and issued the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we went by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Minster of Our Lady stood and so the pilgrim went from the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day and evening the individual day tours were framed by a short pulse with different prayers, songs and text texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis stopped at field crossroads, chapels or churches time and again to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrim songs."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parish church of the local parishes was available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, one took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but first had to save some 500 altimeters in the warm-up heat and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing cloister church of St. Peter, it passed the final stage to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, Minis arrived in the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy."</seg>

<seg id="20">"after the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. the yoke made the legend proud when he stormed home to cover a victory from the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they only got a modest sixth place at the London rail world championships in London."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who won Hoy 4 years ago - and Skinner won an olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder was running short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation going into a higher gear in order to slow it down and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It is a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic Port and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on Kenny's and Hoys side, he admitted that after a weak start he purposely fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said:" "it feels like London with all the UK flags."</seg>
<seg id="24">We joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would mean Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will be focused on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued with officials before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time took place in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a raft of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary account of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing killings as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt-making of Portland due to the cancellation of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium smelter in Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts as the supplying energy company communicates."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision at the beginning of this year, not to give any further subsidy to the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy specified for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk during closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt-making process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt-melt of Alcoa in Portland loses cash and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL income from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts has already been amortized in its annual subscription to the amount of $187 million in "expectation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melt "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year even if there is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts" statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that wouldn't be good for us as a generating set," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the sought after September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), fragmented reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's most popular Showbiz-Uncle and Producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the clichém action of almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take part in this publicity somehow."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of the Kardashians started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the journal are still punched before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, the model "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success is not pleasing to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistress of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But hopping around on the displeasure seems to be passing by.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was pretty clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the beginning, the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would be enough for two selfies with high resolution."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we run a lot of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefit from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in atmospheric growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave both the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalk in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as back up our future business and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to one of the software manufacturers, companies who earn money with online advertising are trying to bypass an ad block, a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blogger in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding for his advertisements to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of what part of the page advertisement is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of hin-and-forth battle between the allotted open source community and the hangers has been underway since the invention of indicator lights, "and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display lockers; almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues Facebooks."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the company has, apart from advertising blocks on desktop PCs, since mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram shared a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment of such a step.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" "Ad Preferences tool" "to give people more control over it targeted advertising."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying, because they would also block contents on the site that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"this is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," announced a Facebook spokesman in an e-mail communication. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences instead of putting more control over people's hands."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman in the dark said" "in an act of despair" "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police told in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said, calling on them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing following a man crossing and killing a man lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the court found that the policewoman who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way - and that the presence of a man on the road was a" completely unusual and unforeseeable situation, "said the judge."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable once in the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if Venus could have rejected earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus increases its daily rate of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once habitable, Venus -- over several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned out by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know it today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejaden star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the new data helps astronomers understand why stars revolve around different rates in the star cluster, as well as in which connection rotational periods are associated with planetary formation."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other starters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning to the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these mature stars reach large quantities of star-winds."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of any star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull compares stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the Pleiades Ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," "said Rebull."</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates."</seg>

<seg id="8">"on Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games."</seg>

<seg id="1">"data claw: hacker, as perfide, blackmail her ransom"</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware effectively attack companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware crew specialists Malwarebytes under 540 businesses in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmailing software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize heavily on attacks in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be blackmailing is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attunctions was frighteningly fast over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies deal with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off when a ransomware is added."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals already suffered from attacks whose patients could be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only support the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay will get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate heavily and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus supplier Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular box to the actual blackboards.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits originated by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not enough threat to successful retrieval, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Head Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"the damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one rolls around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you don't have to think of sleep well before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be various causes behind them, emphasising Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Disorders and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you mean by the way, however, is the Insomnia, so an entry and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just falling asleep many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this can include organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another illness."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is often common with a depression," says Weber. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, if you have a herniated disc, it can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and starts thinking about everyday problems and worries."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired on the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Woeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: you are beaten, tired, unasleep, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasises the lack of sleep doctors in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises Weber."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the case of snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of sick day fatigue, sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please don't make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the disgusting, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping-end."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of jackbolts on which you can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"she counts on: regular sleeping and standing-up times, not to sleep too long, not to sleep on the day, not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and this is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like this at first glance, but the police are one of the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, one passes some playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"however, in recent weeks, articles about this" trendy borough, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will however prefer to be billed with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, Berlin's inner senator Henkel has expressed itself repeatedly in favour of a hard action by the police against the project, designating the area as a" no-go zone "for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the Cadets, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, police patroled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three manning cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on July 13, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers removed from the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain before late-night."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are especially annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the care of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who in majority regards police protection against the vandaliatory left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police put on between house owners and their neighbours, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district, which today, in comparison with the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high poverty risk. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Riga River."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and choice berliner from all over the world over the last few years. residents from GDR times and former home owners now share their neighborhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rent that has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on discarded disks or newly painted facades, which were thrown with color-bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year as often as "left-wing violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: criminal offences like bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes make material damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated buildings."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is more important: people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for those who studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here you help each other, live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer moved consciously into the Riga Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important that the residents get their streets back: from the police, politicians and the media, which all of a sudden claimed the interpretation of the city district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through thoughtless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, they are condos which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so good here live here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws near should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a tavern, complaining badly about noise there."</seg>

<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the Municipality and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been quite difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it does not work, if you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments need to be rectified, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be erected in the Washinstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be gutted or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here, there is administration and honorary official."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problem cases," "says customer honestly," "People with whom nothing works." "therefore, the work of Deuschle and client is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: are they afraid of radicalization after recent occurrences, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine's customer quite clearly, "what some may call naively." a residual risk could and would not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"in other words, the main and honorary official must look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they have always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customers also make it clear that they are already working at the same time to sensibly integrate the existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
