Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu for lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; with the deal raised by Obama about the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech , which has partly been considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election of Israel that was at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor tries to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog , &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ gra@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous distress at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed it .
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; he himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have health reasons , saying that he had some health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee him an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , lamb st@@ ole himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
&quot; at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls were f@@ used when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and lives in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced fifteen years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose two years ago both on a summer fair market .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmonic playing in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , presi@@ ded over the first semester program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community took part in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot himself , and that lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas seasonal employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox swe@@ ats over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simulated bow and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd along with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the greatest Time Travel movie ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN head says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict of almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the br@@ ink of the Minist@@ erial Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Survey results indicating that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nomin@@ ating the Real Estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims Tr@@ ump will likely win Repub@@ lican nomin@@ ee .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump@@ ur staying power and start dropping their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a transi@@ ent phase :
tr@@ umps Ar@@ bit@@ r@@ als have rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see tr@@ umps of temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first country in the country , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their hats , Repub@@ lican voters keep Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it is shown that a variety of GO@@ P elec@@ tors Tr@@ ump campaign can be viewed as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to water pumps , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally spot Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one really can say never to change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Com@@ m@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al focus was on public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l from Monday , six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do too . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new heights .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , you will find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers one square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , there is a price like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ time scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have described the FC Bayern in the witch @-@ vessel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their match in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympic champion in hot atmosphere thanks to Miller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th match in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller was rewarded with the help of Olympic @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who passed a f@@ lange of the World &apos;s Mayor . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; said Bayern Captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the match at Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest home games in the Royal class , among them famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often in their aggressive efforts to work in@@ genu@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were induced too often by game shift on left @-@ air Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; first of all , as an Olympic champion , Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Polish head ball ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved to their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put needle pun@@ ches . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was also a decree .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said the chairman Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski , who had been killed ( 59 . ) . &quot;
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later .
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
&quot; after a smaller group of partially m@@ um@@ bling Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich hang@@ ers . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when doing so , the risk decl@@ ines fast . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international team of researchers , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; tooth loss causes tooth decay and gum inflammation , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of cavi@@ ties .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ke to the level of non @-@ smoking , said Er@@ aser Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people of being non @-@ smokers , declared director of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of el@@ essness affects the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists find lef@@ to@@ vers from the late anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rh@@ en@@ ish bou@@ lev@@ ard , the archae@@ ologists have now found it . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it has already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , which belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; declared Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström responsible for the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de plans to launch the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through the TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will rise to 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings will con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely envis@@ age that the EU states and the United States are jointly choosing independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
&quot; so far , the proceedings involved have agreed among themselves to arbit@@ ers , and there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion over the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court in accordance with its own data . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , through which companies can make compensation for the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in initial statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ king ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into consideration the key points taken by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the negotiations on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; until now , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting fol@@ ks@@ eller filmed the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of different places he always records on the map , about his delicate and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
where they came into being and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be held in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece appeared in 2005 . &quot;
sur@@ rendering to ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and lacks an annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic inter@@ locking pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; apart from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle from ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without directing a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can throw away the &quot; &quot; plate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens only hum@@ bles himself to an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awaited by Prime Minister Fra@@ gran@@ ce &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs close by .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also within Labour &quot; st@@ acking , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour changed to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the Shadow Workers and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another politi@@ cian , says he has ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question of question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of economic ministers when he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also had the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch @-@ P@@ unch @-@ Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose steep@@ ly according to data showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and most successful estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after acquisition of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods , the Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
the latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ ardi@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the capital : on Bi@@ eber @-@ Expedition in Berlin

rather even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin last night .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the Bi@@ eber construction : here you can see I@@ dol , whose poster hangs in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;

&quot; she says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth class in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who &apos;s it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
&quot; also , Bi@@ eber doesn &apos;t . &quot;
he has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the promotional break of the Super@@ market he c@@ ashed three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ p company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber @-@ account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks coffee , you wonder at the window . &quot;
it is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese man on the potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or twe@@ eters ?
&quot; both - in the potato dum@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the word &quot; potato instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wording &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Lebanese had the idea to register with the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and as much potatoes as the sk@@ ewer contains , so Al@@ hay wants to betra@@ y it . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with his customers , the culinary understanding of international understanding is well received . &quot;
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches In@@ flu@@ ence Camp@@ a@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ sp@@ ection
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers leap on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes further details of its defensive strategy on September 29th , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and to remove all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost some 13 million dollars of earnings before interest and taxes , &quot; said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash has lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley anticip@@ ates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told us that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Directors of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , rep@@ els and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in order to improve their stores through fast growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and charging recovery programmes are to be put to an end and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ res and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; soon after that , in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison shou@@ ted , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential U.S. Open @-@ win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious of is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little in the battle , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan on the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the lim@@ eli@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared Emer@@ gency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that attempted to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a man &apos;s land , and Ser@@ b officials responded with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence fought for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some had returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels not to agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would accept more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
the emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block the streets and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent , Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata , reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insisted that most arriving economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence built by the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said Inter@@ governmental spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we clearly say it : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still approve the use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of having committed crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence swiftly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos changed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders ranked second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders here is only 5 points behind . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a great advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters throughout the country say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them , because it is the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
it may not be surprising that Clinton &apos;s current suppor@@ ter is especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just one quarter she would enthusi@@ astically support .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s suppor@@ ter is asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
&quot; from Clinton &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
agre@@ eing to deal with the problems and di@@ vis@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president acc@@ uses a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries will be asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
of Clin@@ tons fans say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ ze for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , democratic voters call questions about the constitu@@ tion@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results in some important features of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; in the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off by hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked during the term as foreign minister , most Demo@@ cra@@ cies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinion altogether . &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on her general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion of her had even worsen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of ten who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nation@@ ally view Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good marks on leadership .
&quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the rate of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump with the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is eliminated , and others lose their support dramatically . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and passes Tr@@ ump under Repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen in the deepest place , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % . &quot;
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he ends with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing tourists already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even more warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic Sea , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a fatal ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death . &quot;
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he dropped unconscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly warned an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ geln , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members started to hide utensils and basically put the good of the br@@ otherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ z@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of malicious attacks and the formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned it , we will also account for it , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their belonging to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a net interest increase comes , and the house @-@ se will fall into shaking , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
&quot; here , a view based on historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is a tendency for net income to be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank analysts in a newer study on what has happened after the F@@ ed increases . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is usually in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return on Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate rise of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only doubled the nominal GDP by 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter of the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; if this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market players have set themselves on a net interest rate increase throughout the year , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all growth cycles between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions have been put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , ren@@ ders appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the recovery cycle , the bond returns drop immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to conver@@ gence between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded , and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and entire sectors , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will profit from it when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts will be po@@ orer because an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also funding their debts .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure shares , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of Parliament critic@@ ised the radio station for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 turns into &quot; &quot; Classic FM &quot; , &quot; maintains a leading member of the parliament and raises new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn into classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just another name to The Br@@ its . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I think is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins brought The Voice to - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC way . &quot;
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stall &quot; when the next time it star@@ es a series of entertainment .
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money in other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose in August the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total spending for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales were intensified three years ago , when buyers started working with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers rose around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
experts believe that Black Friday at which the buyers fought for bar@@ gain buyers could stop shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 expenditure spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first burial ground in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia det@@ aches the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in total , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale bank .
&quot; bot@@ her@@ ed , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect , when the first of the dead comp@@ eted their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession went over to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then to the worshi@@ ppers . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane supported . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi @-@ Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the Grand @-@ mo@@ z@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which was later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a apo@@ state son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crane crash occurred in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to be paid to the relatives of the killed , and the same amount of permanent injured . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; Brit@@ ons increasingly employ cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is said that British sett@@ ling their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out work in their homes
&quot; if you can handle a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British increasingly employ cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to carry out jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new president of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services to grav@@ ure prices has now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 selling points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are hit by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; king@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has owned 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group reduced the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the K@@ lagen@@ furt Regional Court , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of government .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary examination , the defend@@ ants used funds from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial intermedi@@ ation .
&quot; this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ person of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association did not come into existence at any time an asset . &quot;
&quot; sports officials had only calculated expenses and the sports club for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ maker &apos;s wholesale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have given money to take our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in case of appropriate financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense reimbur@@ s@@ ements has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was deposited on the account . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , flat and not detail bookings also appeared , the former chairman described the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the two defend@@ ants shared the accounts and the as@@ par@@ ag@@ us , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial support , it was important only to have debt free , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that had been set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second accused and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not answer this question for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as a claim res@@ titu@@ tion .
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the official said that he never bought a cent salary , he only paid o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; at diets he was charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to present exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept in place after an operation test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also obtained o@@ dom@@ eter money .
&quot; in his statement , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel mining , which has been running for three years , further jobs will be disman@@ tled in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up of the company . &quot;
the positions at the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 fiscal year , HP had a workforce of around 30@@ 2,000 . &quot;
&quot; on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the corporation , which was raised with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , California , is now emerging : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led together in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a further dis@@ appo@@ inting PC market , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers in terms of its services , was the latest in the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; as a result , revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more business online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be overwhel@@ m@@ ingly opposed : 54 per cent said , 35 per cent showed themselves appro@@ ving . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a co @-@ operation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent . &quot;

&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the slogan &quot; Mobility connecting &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the organizers of the V@@ DA car association expect some 900@@ ,000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred displaced persons .
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he told us by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and a water@@ front was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially continued to use pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew a little back .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees stuck in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ men also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point to the fact that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Stim@@ m at Delta State University bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could not do it &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Do@@ cent for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot on a man , and he killed a man . &quot;
&quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre , that police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss who had a dog named Light@@ ning had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville on that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor allegedly participated with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this surely demands its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union . &quot;
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with its new position , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphasizes the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict conflict with the pilot group Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed following the planned strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement rules for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; Cockpit hopes &quot; &quot; will be able to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim care of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept is in the background . &quot;
it seems that the Lufthansa Cargo is shifting to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat in Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left outside defender to cry and would exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being put into hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with age 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian ump@@ ire had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at PS@@ V

&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno had a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel so sorry about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the ec@@ ologist Dr. Se@@ uss , published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead gives a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ i @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ i @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , li@@ stens through the cov@@ et@@ ous , tree @-@ prone , thin @-@ bloo@@ ded creature , &quot; &quot; speaking in the name of the trees &quot; . &quot; &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably coming from Cameron &apos;s election circuit office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that Camer@@ ons &apos;s staff was delivered , but there were no immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , there is no repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my card . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t exclude a down@@ turn .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ ins in bat@@ ting , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid develops himself , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been prolonged , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he hopes for further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and abroad .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales enters and he is a drummer I guess .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as the ones before him , but this depends , of course , on the establishment of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and get four qui@@ cks , emerged and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s vi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ een might not have done his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred res straight away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the coaching staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a champion coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful engagement into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what is said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = leaving Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy falls into a l@@ uten@@ sil until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ o@@ cious ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be in trouble with every passing day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ated on Tuesday because of Europe . &quot;

&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , then come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants a UK looking outside in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin , and shows that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we will stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a fade @-@ in force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers even intentionally do not plan helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press species , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ro@@ gue , phone @-@ ch@@ opping foreigners , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals , most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bla@@ ir really thought about it , but found out that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor to him . &quot;
the press never with@@ drew it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly touch on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC van he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ der realms of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour @-@ cabinet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said nor what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the ear @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite @-@ Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - will foreign diplom@@ ats be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power where I was reminded of something about the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been issued by British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received following reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting members of the board are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the Group &quot; is sign@@ posted , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the alle@@ gations made by BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national responsibility . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders says former chief of Channel 4
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time slots against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that for six years he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which are also clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast charge , which I think medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least use its production on programs that others do not do or give in order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wi@@ dest possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense , of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funding programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I have to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think it would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson - an entrepreneur for series that ch@@ aired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for the pursuit of ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support .
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes reflect what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think , we all think that one gets a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for £ 150 , I wonder if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ ther@@ an Mission . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to change , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful were shown on television , and with the commercial channels to make alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled from out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
impulses work by switching off mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms presented the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could replace lower brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultras@@ on@@ ically to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fibre , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves tissues can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - by creating an Excel spread@@ sheet - and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tw@@ o@@ fold corporate advertisement , but &quot; by blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation it remains strong . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded in front of our front door .

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love or hate Mar@@ m@@ ite because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave you .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , movie night venues and community meeting points , but they are also the places where people get dressed and put on their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to : do not think about starting university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a space @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking about kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an established b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat will cause people to sleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student homes .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they are saying to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , adding a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it was a matter of making a little qui@@ eter for them , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with still lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 am , she kindly sent her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour examination . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse was accidentally moving into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to them , separate yourself and see them every day and maybe experience how they all come across all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to pronoun@@ ce a little reason to your lower abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good st@@ ony is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but don &apos;t forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys into a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; holiday homes for refugees , single @-@ moving , Ger@@ ing @-@ worshi@@ ppers &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; so , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the ger@@ min@@ ate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly favourable living space can be created : he builds holiday homes for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gu@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a large part .
&quot; given the flow of refugees , we need enough housing for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you put people in blocks of housing .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have completed my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ clas@@ sm@@ s special construction and the pitch ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still subordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what &apos;s definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but luxury apartments have been built that hardly can afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
I show how one can still build cheap and good today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; software update has failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this by reducing the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged while you update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full Attack
&quot; in the fight for the title track title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup runner emphas@@ ised the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in front of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races so far and also ki@@ cked off the flood light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a ha@@ ze bell hangs above the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1. class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which was accepted by the chairman Alfred Klein .
&quot; this makes it possible to record chess players , who cannot afford the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the Schach@@ club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district Office is looking for direct contact
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly care centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the Social Foundation &apos;s coat of arms , and opened a new starting point at the count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and coun@@ cill@@ ors receive information on issues such as care insurance or services provided by health and nursing staff . &quot;
&quot; for years , our out@@ patient nursing staff has established that nursing relatives are often left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; not seldom many of the insur@@ ances will not be avail@@ ed because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper , Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ tizen Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del described , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both business leaders in a particularly demographic shift .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of the city of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ able gather@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away at the age of 92
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus borrow@@ ed an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the outer space . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after World War II . &quot;
&quot; he worked as a freelance architect since 1952 , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of For@@ estry . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treas@@ ury in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palais des Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years . &quot;
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , on the other hand , he did not listen . &quot;
&quot; meadow had just cut the hair in the city center of Bremen , when he saw how a parking space guard turned out a ticket for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; after that , meadow r@@ ushed out of the business , insul@@ ted the proj@@ ec@@ tin , and repro@@ ached her against her feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only afterwards I will decide whether meadow will be shown , or not . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim had a nose and ble@@ ed strongly out of his nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dropped off his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home , and mar@@ ched past several times . &quot;
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
&quot; with the aid of a head@@ stock , one re@@ counted on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to a hospital in order to provide medical care .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue project description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and enco@@ ders to report on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank Müller assumes office breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich , Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert , are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over Fel@@ ce@@ ausen &apos;s practice on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on hand for his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the field stand met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice during the year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I simply called her . &quot;
Mr. Müller liked the idea to practice his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so they agreed that the tr@@ ash bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , following his medical studies in Hanover , and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz District and was involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the d@@ ump@@ sters , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to sit down as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gil@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speech room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 Euros will be given to the mil@@ ler as part of a funding program of the district ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ ong mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ dol@@ a , about 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen each quarter , in the north German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor had found herself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; consultations , inci@@ dentally , still look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the field of rock . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell , an era ended in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the medical professionals practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen smiling . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she felt a little sad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot;
&quot; her husband comments : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum claim can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; it is clear , however , that there is a need for clear signals , &quot; &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had announced beforehand that Slovenia would also let incoming refugees continue in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; this was the case , however , that Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to impose its borders on refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried to pass by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in the night @-@ hours to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continuously hit police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country expects about 4000 refugees , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary happened , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west elevation . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities of border control . &quot; &quot;
we carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country concerning the standard of border controls . &quot;
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to paci@@ fy Wednesday morning with a local vision in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at present .
&quot; one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to refugees in which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance teams were sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard of a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of having gained an insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim site .
&quot; people do their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly lei@@ surely stroll . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city ways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big tables each with the title &quot; &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid drew attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ers spontaneously access the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer for long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; on the br@@ ink of discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ oni plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Association for the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone on the boards wants to express themselves publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still sti@@ gmati@@ sed with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of the people . &quot;

the funeral and mourning atten@@ dant is one of the honorary employees of the first hour .
&quot; confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy was sought by volunteers , she immediately reported and was there at the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ants accompanied in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
they are all thoroughly trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her duties and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further education and supervision of the funeral and funeral companions .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the pla@@ ques on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter and the supplier gi@@ ants reduced his profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ land transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Meetings said earning a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; the lower outlook comes despite the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ land transpor@@ tations of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; produces solid earnings if we consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by twelve of Z@@ ack &apos;s investment research analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked six of Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; sales increased 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies en@@ vision two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;

the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other matters .
the central bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices are stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy shows that it grows solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are seeing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel , Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what makes the financial market uncertain .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase of interest this week .
&quot; financial markets however expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the impact by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a price increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was continually below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would put on the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s currency authority . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then , in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial markets that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ner , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , ple@@ dged to raise interest rates , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market conflict in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not believe it should advance the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
among them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 lots .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with images of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ards gym@@ nasi@@ um
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out of the gym@@ nasi@@ um on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport area is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , among other things , the Board approved an application for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; permission was given for a special form regarding roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ cent@@ red roof and roof top &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; background planning is the planned use of the roof@@ ing surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof ti@@ lt that was prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - was below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan permits no &quot; exceptions &quot; in terms of the roof ti@@ lt , whereby the general council generally leaves more restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tion orders . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recurring project , however : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent for this , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are estimated at the cost .
sur@@ pl@@ uses are expected from the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will be presented to the District Office for Ex@@ am@@ ination . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees mig@@ rate from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision will be made to the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue . &quot;
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the rooms are present .
&quot; employees who cannot go to Sch@@ on@@ gau , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on October 1st and change his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means in each case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and an extension of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board cons@@ ents to the Supervisory Board , both houses will lead , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ appe , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this in 2018 , when the ongoing rehabilitation of the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ t@@ ess J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , argued that the house , owned by the Federal Ar@@ med Forces , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a daily esp@@ it@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity would not come back , &quot; Fischer said about the quasi parade to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
&quot; today , the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC . &quot;
&quot; although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
in the past season the bad@@ ener at Bh@@ c referred to a painful defeat and have something to do there .
Jag@@ dun@@ nage with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the ab@@ bey on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police shared . &quot;
after a shot an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought in hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who had been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who had been missing since Saturday , fell victim to violent crimes . &quot;
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern .
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also captured on Tuesday night , is considered to be a crime suspect , and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for a young woman , investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing persons , a crime of crimes against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally revealed . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the deta@@ inees were admitted to the police station to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead bodies into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop on him . &quot;
the further investigations are intended to provide information on the immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against vac@@ ancy
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social H@@ ousing .
&quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ class accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers came to the rent in the last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant savings in housing development over the past few years .
Germany is shooting a budget deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; some 77@@ ,000 units of housing were currently missing in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , compla@@ ined Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; many professionals , therefore , lived in large cities in need of share in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the exposure to the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should stimulate social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , the property tax will be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for the German state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros had already been accessed on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer a transit country , as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; the route , however , is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television channel RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also making ordinary asylum procedures superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; &quot; they can travel and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , it was people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most media reports were from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and with taxis .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; however , after the closure of the border there are hardly more refugees coming to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people . &quot;
shortly before the deadline on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border city as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 pen@@ alties were initiated . &quot;
the defend@@ ants threatened prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants were 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stuck there .
&quot; practically , no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the border town has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this modification .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reach only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country following government orders . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
&quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; across the border &quot;
&quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clean up , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the rocks coinci@@ ded with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we had the unexpected guests su@@ cked first , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to reach it after the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still crossing the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was put off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , the day before a two @-@ bridge run sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends yet another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s bearings immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanitarian , our Federal Chancellor has publicly acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; yellow land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , in which we produce decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the look@@ out for 35@@ ,000 ber@@ win@@ ed quarters &quot;
&quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , said Con@@ rad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s no ass without the ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the state cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , clari@@ fying how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; Help us like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for placing them as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that district employers have to respect a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the sky@@ light . &quot;
&quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was successful in accommodation , Konrad establishes with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older Lord , to whom one does not speak to the face the un@@ truth . &quot;
belief is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
&quot; until now , the own quest for cross @-@ arti@@ facts has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are obviously problems with permission . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for now , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons affected are currently without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for an emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism exercises the city chief on the division of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister , Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action on the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available . &quot;
&quot; the protective @-@ seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
the fact that Austria once again carries out checks on its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger from the actions of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - while Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; worth 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to move the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ar@@ cade : after all , she has gained an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I thought for a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the deciding factor was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest gave birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women , looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the expert with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of each outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the for@@ e@@ bears of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for you .
&quot; whether he mani@@ f@@ ests himself in a foreign language , as far as journalists are concerned or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy , the candidate for the US presi@@ dency stir@@ s up the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur is a term many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village are related to him via ump@@ teen corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ mün@@ ster Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , among which besides Tr@@ ump is also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks to Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit big , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , had explained to the start of the film . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking testim@@ onies of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ates , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; he is always so four thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the landlord Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family in a visit ended something for the church organ , which is generally good . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ t@@ eller Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the US awak@@ ens interest . &quot;
the Upper @-@ Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; clim@@ ber village &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the reviews for Today . &quot;
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the German capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the situation seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 viewers in the five main cities compared with Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to sunrise in recent months .
&quot; in August today it reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decided to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could have a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven stayed strongly with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe yiel@@ ded 44@@ ,000 spectators on average . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 was generated . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.@@ m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets to be revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before you check@@ out three two , you may accidentally have given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have set out in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; could their answers become a cor@@ rup@@ tible , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be good as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally set on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
in his press conference Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his caught catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only care for the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meeting to discuss gay rights
&quot; Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Si@@ berian escal@@ ation with weapons of arms . &quot;
&quot; after being openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was sentenced to seize his oil company Yu@@ kos and blocked his democratic endea@@ vors . &quot;
&quot; due to the high influ@@ x of refugees , the free voters demand the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W fall retreat in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get de@@ valu@@ ations in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the regional Sunday parliamentary fraction conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ toral Committee .
&quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN security zones for refugees in Syria , just as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers wish to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum compla@@ ining : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards in the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot;
but the country policy in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ lasting favourite remains on the agenda : education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , culture minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; at 47 Gym@@ na@@ sia , where an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um middle stage was tested for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; the issue G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that we want .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
festive Wall Street helps Da@@ x jump on the jumps
&quot; the German stock market has closed , according to a trend @-@ free and nervous trade course with profits over long distances . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges ensured a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ based Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro Sto@@ xx 50 as the euro@@ zone &apos;s financial index reached 1,@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid gains also earned the trading posts in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many stock exchanges expect the markets to take place until after the interest in the US and the major decline on the fut@@ ures markets on this Friday . &quot;
&quot; the debate surrounding the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , and also left deep marks at E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government has denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the Da@@ x peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive impact on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors at the moment gave too little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold more than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers by car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen advantages increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on stock exchange listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Swiss pension index of Rex increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federal @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the course of the euro sank to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to USD 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police missi@@ les fired into a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior investig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station and some of them threw rocks and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber missi@@ les used , known of which are known to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high rate of death . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rid@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

preparations are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; we wait for appropriate offers , that is to say on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor should come into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the land , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner big street , bought already a few months ago and the building on it had to be torn down . &quot;
P@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for a holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
a number of investors are concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure vehicle
&quot; for months behind closed doors was negotiated , plan@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday cottage on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on to the offensive from the system @-@ building management : &quot; we haven &apos;t answered any questions yet , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
&quot; for months , the project , which is about ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion . &quot;
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called forth the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z overlooked by all the other blo@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; he also fears , like many other project critics , that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all bus loads must come to fru@@ i@@ tion , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent approach , &quot; Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends said . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling fund campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund campaign to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first glob@@ alized donations have doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / de eli@@ ef to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , driven by more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya . &quot;
reports from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery may be helpful for slightly obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight relative to size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c scar@@ ring - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition decreased completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and only about two percent in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater rel@@ a@@ sions in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obes@@ e people who were less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is re@@ ass@@ uring for individuals with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and was pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
&quot; the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of consumption of hand des@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , taking strong alcoholic hand des@@ infection agents , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant deliberately while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mutation in the social media . &quot;
YouTube videos show how young people can drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
teenagers re@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash@@ es to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant reach out within reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes from following the earthquake sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ al@@ ded her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York scheduled to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; bul@@ g@@ amm@@ ers &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ours of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers middle @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic football fans , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ ment from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen followed , with five points ahead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this right way - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
getting together is so important .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland dropped by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland declined to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland had taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; over the past 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot;

why I should be a witness of an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to view exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it without emotion .
I can &apos;t .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have form@@ ulate better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please check the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he focused on the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria integrity department , claiming that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ay due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t tu@@ ff test at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat down for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart have sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ ammer .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should that bring me to the point that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and put me away , and I have no doubt that what I say can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the coaching level of the trainer was based on the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching explained that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the Sunday treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; after a pack had been laid mud or clay on the horse deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day like this yesterday .
but it was also on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested one man on the weekend after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and followed pilot flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with driver assistance and lower assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring @-@ fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark about the Storm Team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the ring .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ g of his team and said that they were concentrated only on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that always appears again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson speaking about ring games when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focal point and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it is strange as this always appears during this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compar@@ es his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a cra@@ p . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you &apos;d like to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they did not think about us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tries in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them at a stage . &quot;
the Storm team is free on this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the Pre @-@ final at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin in the next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drug deposit &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a lifetime sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ like penalty for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an said . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian pas@@ sports , reports to the police on a daily basis and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
&quot; in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep in an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches that used words to search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty in the sense of the act of indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children viol@@ ated on 14 June last year and not to appear before court at a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; Gregor S@@ im &apos;s defence lawyer asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings on other cases pending . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the Jud@@ gement date .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ users let people from fear of discovery and arrest increased the number of smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the river B@@ order river Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and st@@ umps .
&quot; there , they are received by German police officers and passed on to the registration . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station saw clearly more refugees than at the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the provincial capital only until 8 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even to Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ sea @-@ circle with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 km per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is especially noticeable in the compact cars that are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( September 17 to 27 ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models are being presented among all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a new entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp up to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be on the new compact cars next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only to be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ating sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; he comes to trade early next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti perfectly adju@@ sts to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers appe@@ aled to the front . here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the At@@ tor@@ ney General Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot;
this was the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judge , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who was now on the free foot after his lawyer &apos;s testimony was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for a new trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
Kammer@@ gericht now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al now has to clarify the amount of money compensation .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so they said , in April , a prisoner of damage , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 for decent accommodation . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was placed between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also entered the head@@ lines due to missing staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ cket because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information provided by the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated decisi@@ veness in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that .
&quot; what happens in Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it was built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favourable homes will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to arise every year , and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Construction Ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees in recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; whereas previously there was a prohibition of work for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residential duty to limit the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view has generally prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
&quot; so far , there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is , in the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ eing parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eln@@ bar , Spo@@ kes@@ person for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage in them , says Be@@ ate St@@ über from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to so far was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
willing to study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any services after the asylum application law more , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ e as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to exercise . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare federation that takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
duties also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to acc@@ use religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade now , an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general gender equality law . &quot;
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed where police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding long and why international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism prevention of Germany commit , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees previously expected , says District President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money would have to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards at the same time . &quot;
the services rendered could be rep@@ lic@@ ated later with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut down so many people with the limited range of services offered by the asylum application law . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors especially do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , it demands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees have been helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , there are much more in@@ treated disabilities among refugee children , and in the youth it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partially different diseases , German doctors come from their education , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , the refugees may even allevi@@ ate relief . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a sophisticated education system , and many refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be able to practice , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the German psych@@ otherap@@ ist ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic Stress Dis@@ order suffer from so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat , and death fears . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong anxiety and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; Mun@@ z said , in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psych@@ otherapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the welfare offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst resorts to the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the brick @-@ in @-@ was@@ en invites you to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ ress and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ tite @-@ staging . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift for the enthusiasts is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them away for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the barely 3,@@ 000@@ km long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the circus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family enter@@ tains the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record it . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ atures , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger @-@ tip @-@ feeling and arti@@ fici@@ ality . &quot;
balancing on a sphere with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ anie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , are read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot;
so the upper@@ most order : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , something is likely to be there . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; no matter if 5 or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 to 20 : 00 .
&quot; on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also under@@ pinn@@ ed by claims by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ gged him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of parliament that the immunity in parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the Chief Apostle said that the party run by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will split into two listed companies this year , and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected down@@ turn leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously unt@@ apped , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explained the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of his history , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal properly .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a decent period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope his body will stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the far @-@ off hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy Show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has become more du@@ bi@@ ous than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
&quot; in the age of communication guided by social media , with its focus on substance over substance , immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at soccer matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a telephone staff member told me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel capable of talking to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest on this weekend with the perfect backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k ? &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani took the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the prince park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Levin . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three modifications to the Paris team , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and passing beautifully into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone thought that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some mis@@ es and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ te in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to turn Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved its sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi missed a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League match was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by stock sales

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously a few years ago , Bayern Munich was just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , two time club champion , twice champion champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was already standing out of Barcelona in front of the 2008 European Championship . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time , Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ bl@@ ings wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann was taken over by FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has been under contract and I have played a great Euro . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns playing time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown was interrupted when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the filling of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nun , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing the film . Dam@@ on answered that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their variety - this is SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement reported nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against color content . &quot;
&quot; in February , singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; albums quietly matter &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prize of $ 1 million home .
&quot; the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal fin@@ als there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing was part of a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; Isaac said ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , it gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to touch over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tiger &apos;s manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit pun@@ ched three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rounds , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he had a good sw@@ ung out of sleep , &quot; &quot; said Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( strike training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed spin Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a double play
&quot; after adding an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
but the right @-@ handed rider stab@@ s S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit was the pr@@ elu@@ de to the game from an un@@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been d@@ ashed against the game from the list of injuries after he had been missing more than a month for a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;d wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , making a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman , Nick Castell@@ anos , followed a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers ranked second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit him very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter .
&quot; he is being studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
San@@ che@@ z has been on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder @-@ sh@@ red@@ ding and should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is cancelled from the list of injuries to fight against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees will be in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was awaited for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived there should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , according to the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; Collec@@ tive Direc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for massive stock@@ pil@@ ing of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening at Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it was agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement on which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the general secretary for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany . &quot;
she did not call for concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers intend to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cking in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
Merkel under@@ lined those people who would need protection .
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania was blocked with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ ins a global ocean .
this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the moon sw@@ ells on its path around the ring plane . &quot;
&quot; this do@@ ve movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist leaf .
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered Eis@@ volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers concluded back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must do without Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich lions , diagnosis is expected to take four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , with a view of the possible obligation of a non @-@ compatible professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old NO@@ Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week . &quot;
the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h at the head .
&quot; contrary to his first fears , he remained without a severe prof@@ ess@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain plenty of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them B @-@ vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ é and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS , for Christmas business in the USA , represents up to 9@@ 5,000 ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS has increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 help . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ eh@@ y storm , then marked cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alps @-@ side of the F@@ öhn on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wedn@@ es@@ days and in the night for th@@ urs@@ day , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows through the fo@@ eh@@ ement valleys . &quot;
&quot; after bo@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west flow . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys during the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ i@@ als with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my F@@ öhn winds for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow on the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter will be expected to be expected . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the blow dryer takes off the air , as a result a cold front with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east is rolling over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind is refresh@@ ed up to stor@@ my weather and the temperatures drop significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are in the north of autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south it is sunny and warmer at temperatures of up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ place
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on Wednesday was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the town as a rotten sin @-@ making ba@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the decline .
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with sum@@ p@@ tuous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 subjects formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; Book of Books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles which dev@@ ote subjects like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land have ar@@ isen . &quot;
&quot; with this he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into current , current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original scrip@@ tural quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions were the cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Order of Malta . &quot;
&quot; so the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up that , in order to be able to tolerate the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to return art to more importance in a short @-@ lived period : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall into the images , &quot; let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like him to live with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t care to capture the Bible completely , but also selected the mysterious themes that were important to him . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for m@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway approaches
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ eled for a round course : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway there was already an end . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ astic , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill was scre@@ ened up , new space looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will go into October , the first com@@ mon@@ place Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga was a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football responds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in dealing with the pending problems .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say that this doesn &apos;t bother me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday , I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
soccer can and wants to help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ out , however , must put forward the policy . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; declared Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs place a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee tragedy goes on , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we football fans can , no , we must use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European qualification game against Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , together with the DF@@ B and the German federal government , the association provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : head of the SAP Board loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye for several reports by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen into a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost im@@ pu@@ dent , he was power@@ less and then tow@@ ed out onto the street - he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will return to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; something can happen to everyone . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you have fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of fight ...

Bv@@ C ( Number of result : 2 ) September ( Number of result : 2 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally broken up in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ ckle will not only change its root position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
he announced a change at the goal keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of family @-@ keepers Roman bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Tu@@ ckle was open to whether it will be used in all European league games in the future . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , considers middle @-@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong with that . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
&quot; according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , intends to invest in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the IA@@ A fair of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states who come together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A .
&quot; among other things , the transport ministry &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid switching to digital radio communications . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; so that &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver , &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as drivers . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment , and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads should not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the research organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that in the next ten years , only eight percent of Germans believe that 32 percent believe that 31 percent believe not at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by the Digital Association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 per cent of the traffic could be expected on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would give the car control under no circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current status , Düssel@@ dorfer will only open up in singles with the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ gger Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European programme in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; declared the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits became the great star of the fashion scene - and that he was putting men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can &apos;t say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was carried out : in order to celebrate the d@@ olls , a sty@@ list was specifically hired for example . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the mo@@ ver bar@@ red 14 tonnes of material according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants out@@ fits with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay for his first own fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ tu@@ zy lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops were created in large numbers for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Peak , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and with regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private specialty shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; exports are also weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the United States . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we are environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically above all , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ treated the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in the process , the machine cuts small chi@@ cks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße said : &quot; &quot; previously , I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s lace - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador to the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ film , but rather a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firmly convinced : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy needs to be broad@@ ly open to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and pushing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested according to and after and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing state business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open sectors controlled by the state , other areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nervous pesti@@ cide . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is present in the EU &apos;s corresponding working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury from one to two milli@@ grams per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that around 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; this is why the lowering of gul@@ ps is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain above all in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; &quot; even small amounts especially in the case of un@@ born impair@@ ments of the nervous system &quot; &quot; can cause . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum limits in force , but that a &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
&quot; mercury , above all , reaches the environment by burning coal . &quot;
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock in more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
