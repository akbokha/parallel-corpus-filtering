&quot; considering that it is necessary to take additional measures with regard to a smooth functioning of this agreement , &quot;
&quot; in view of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches , &quot;
&quot; in view of the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the watch industry , &quot;
&quot; according to the assumption that the ration@@ alisation rate granted by E@@ bau@@ ches SA and AS@@ U@@ AG at the time of the entry into force of this agreement , and that the quot@@ a mentioned in point B 3 b ) is abol@@ ished at the same time , &quot;

&quot; 1 . the raw materials produced in the Community , which are listed in the list below , as well as the components produced in the Community and other components of the movement produced in Switzerland or in the Community are regarded as equal quality as raw materials and parts of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical properties . &quot;
&quot; from these raw materials and components , the watches and movements assembled must meet the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland . &quot;
2 . the list of raw materials produced in Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 will be revised periodic@@ ally following the following mod@@ alities :
a ) The application for the recording of new raw material cali@@ bres in the list is directed by the associations of the watch industry of the community or the producers of raw materials based in the community . the application is to add a technical description of the raw material cali@@ ber .
the Swiss Watch Chamber is carrying this or the new cali@@ ber immediately to the mentioned list .
&quot; if the inclusion in the list for a raw material cali@@ ber is applied , which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed legal technical control in Switzerland , the Swiss Watch Chamber may reject the recording . &quot;
&quot; B ) The with@@ drawing of the raw materials listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watch industry of the community or from the manufacturer , who had previously requested the record , the Swiss C@@ lock chamber . &quot;
&quot; C ) If the requirements of statutory technical inspection in Switzerland are not authorised , the Swiss C@@ lock Chamber may demand the cancellation of the raw material cali@@ bers from the list ; it is informed of the party concerned . &quot;
&quot; if this does not agree , the procedure may take place within two months after paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; D ) Any request to change the list according to the letters a ) , b ) and c ) will be immediately displayed to the Mi@@ xed Committee of the Swiss Watch Chamber . &quot;
&quot; 3 . when the quality of the quality is established , the Mi@@ xed Commission , which is envis@@ aged in Article 9 of the agreement of 30 June 1967 , will immediately be dealt with the matter . &quot;
&quot; the first party is requested by the Institute for the official quality control in the Swiss watch industry , as well as an appropriate institute of the community , which is designated by the party of the community in order to give a joint report . &quot;
&quot; with regard to this report , the institutes agree to take out watches or movements from a Swiss company and from a company of the community , which is sufficiently representative and is basically no more than 50 clo@@ cks or movements . &quot;
&quot; following the control of these games in accordance with the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with their conclusions and with their proposals . &quot;
the agreement and the attached list will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watch manufacturers by the respective professional associations .

&quot; the agreement entered into force on 1 January 1973 , provided that the rati@@ fication certificates had been exchanged until that date . &quot;
&quot; if the exchange of rati@@ fication documents takes place between 1 January and 30 November 1973 , the agreement will enter into force on the first day of the second month of the second month . &quot;

&quot; a ) On the effective implementation of the safegu@@ ards following this Convention , the association of the organization in accordance with this Convention grants information on nuclear materials , which is subject to safegu@@ arding measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment used to carry out the securing measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization only demands the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on equipment is limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of securing measures in relation to core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On request of the community , the organization is ready to check investment data which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to check in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization , provided that they remain accessible to the organization in the premises of the community without further examination . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the approval of the community and the states to nom@@ inate inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) If the community is either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any given time , the organization of the community and the states proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ eded by this agreement , the Council will discuss the refusal by the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually provide them , according to their agreement , in fact . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are established in such a way that i ) are as small as possible the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities that lie below .
II ) to ensure the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; every State applies to the Organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to fulfill the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the rights and deliver@@ ances of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement are concluded in relation to nuclear materials , when the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer use@@ able for a nuclear activity which is under the viewpoint of securing measures of exposure . &quot;
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to this convention the transfer of core material from the states subject to the securing measures according to this Convention .
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are terminated in relation to nuclear materials , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization conduc@@ ts documents from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ use of the securing measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear materials , which is subject to this Convention , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community agreed with the organisation of such a use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the non @-@ application of the securing measures after this Convention .
&quot; B ) The organization and the community agree to a regulation that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied for so long , when the core material is used for such activity . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the provision is set to determine how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are once again applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of the material in question , or the material concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only covers issues such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a non @-@ sec@@ rec@@ y knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs incurred by each of them in the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , however , extraordinary costs arising from a particular effort of the organization , the organisation reimbur@@ ses these costs , provided that it has been clari@@ fied in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used according to their laws and other provisions , to the organisation and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same manner as on the national citizens of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state in relation to the organization or the organization in relation to the organization or the organization for damages , with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after examination of the relevant information submitted to him by the General Director , the Council shall ensure that the organisation has not been able to check for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missi@@ les in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council deliber@@ ates on which mass has been obtained by the applied security measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state consul@@ ts on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the community and the state concerned to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be subject to disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of the Convention and which shall not be made in the negotiation process or by another by the organization , the community and the states , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states name two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth , who leads the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days following the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure shall be applicable , if within thirty days after nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear @-@ armed states , the contracting party of the contract , and members of the association , in force , i ) when the relevant State of the Organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and &quot;
&quot; if the organization of the organisation noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The Director General informs all member states of the organisation immediately from any change in the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains in force as long as the States Parties to the contract are .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this Agreement signi@@ fies the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to apply when performing the provisions of the part I , as necessary . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the securing measures specified in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such a junction by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; in order to obtain the objectives set out in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the tests carried out by the organisation is provided by an explanation , in which material quantity is not shown for a specific period of material , subject to the accuracy of accuracy for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organisation makes for article 3 full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and actions of the following types and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are closer and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of not measured continu@@ ances nor measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points to the core material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
arrangements that make sure the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
&quot; B ) ur@@ anium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle in the letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not introduced specifically for non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced into the states in a subsequent phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not authorised , the Community is not permitted or desirable from resi@@ dues or desirable , so consult the organization and the community for the use of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree with the mutual agreement that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the Organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is ref@@ und@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is more than 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation indem@@ ni@@ fies the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of nuclear materials released in the states is at no point in any given time . &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the amount of natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should the freed core material be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for re @-@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual as to apply the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements may be extended or amended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the establishment between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in article 62 , the organization provides a summ@@ ar@@ ised inventory of the core material under@@ lying in the states regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other &quot;
&quot; the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action program set at the conference on international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is ham@@ pered by general migration problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organisation will do their utmost to achieve that goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to as &quot; Managing Directors &quot; by the Organization , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is held separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , which are payable on demand in the currency of the state in order of the organization as ste@@ wards of the special account and to deposit at the location of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
&quot; ( II ) the second one in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the deadlines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every member state may request the payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the bai@@ li@@ ff takes about proportional drawing to the cash or the school @-@ j@@ acks in order to cover the expenses for the special loans and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and predictable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each Special Lo@@ an is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the purpose of the organization financed by ordinary funds from the organization . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special loans are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; therefore , they are ref@@ und@@ able at the age of ten free @-@ years in 50 years . &quot;
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
&quot; in order to pay this fee , the amounts to be paid are directly to the organization which it reserves . &quot;
&quot; each special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and the according to the measure of what the car@@ et@@ aker specified at the time of loan granted , may be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special loan . &quot;
&quot; capital withdraw@@ als from special loans are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State . &quot;
&quot; until full awar@@ ding of all special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special loans , the manager teaches the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special loans and the expenses incurred . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year , the car@@ et@@ aker delivers a detailed statement of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC , as soon as possible , provides a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction , resulting from the accounts payable to the account and deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the stand of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organization may agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement , the total amount of the total amount paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement shall be re@@ mitted to the Member States , thus the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States confirm the conclusion of the procedures in question to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat manages these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement will be effective and will take effect on the first day of the month , following the day of entering the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two sentences in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 on the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T en@@ acted the following FOR@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called the &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as Switzerland , is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as the Federal Council , &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company named after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; - will be transferred . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still extensive works are carried out , it is in the interest of the parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable each contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physi@@ cs from the funds provided for both research work , i.e. the cost @-@ wise competitive electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee effective cooperation , the Swiss programme will take over the long @-@ term objectives and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be expanded or amended following examination by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the existing agreement that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II will take place in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project as part of the objective of this agreement .
&quot; with regard to the conduct of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties include an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those that are concluded between the Commission and the states and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that with the time of entering into force of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the promotion of personnel re@@ plac@@ ements , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s Joint Venture with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that the Swiss contract partner can become a contractual partner , whose objective falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts that are concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the bodies , which are entrusted with the implementation of the Association provided in Article 2 , 1 of the Agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , intends to set up a steering committee , the representative representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
to monitor the development of the research work and to draw the best results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is true in respect of all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination among the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * uniqu@@ eness in the interests of both contracting parties to the common goal laid out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme and the common goal laid down in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG has appointed one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities seek it . &quot;
&quot; the advis@@ ers provided by the VG research proposals will provide the best possible scientific results with regard to the funding granted for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task with regard to all research and development work referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee &apos;s Committee , which supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for ensuring that the capacity of the laboratories involved in the work carried out in the program , will lead to this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordination committees used within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the best use of the resources , the staff , and the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a member of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country national , responsible for the core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission concerning the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programmes and the establishment of its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level within the scope of the merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the executive committee , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
Hv@@ G &apos;s opinion on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee &apos;s committee in the field of personnel re@@ plac@@ ements .
the representatives of the two parties work on the works of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme , according to this agreement , is fixed annually to an amount equal to the share of Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of the atom in the Joint Business as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland also has an amount to the Common company J@@ ET , which is defined according to the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this common company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used for the calculation of Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work that is made on account of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amounts to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are set in An@@ nex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of duties or other donations as well as import and import restrictions shall be exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland or acquired items , in this country they may not be dispos@@ ed of free or free of charge , unless there are conditions which the Federal Council appro@@ ves . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to rest and suffering that are paid to these individuals .

agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial state
the B@@ IS could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreements could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future pro@@ visi@@ oning assets of the member states . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some conditions have been mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as their possible extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a loan @-@ opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts were not made before the end of one month following the conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking account of the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; conditions would correspond to those which the B@@ IS applies at the time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds ourselves on the market , the interest rate for the application could achieve a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot;

in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic about trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat from the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are covered as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; within the framework of this agreement , the export potential for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina is set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the actual quantity of the year does not exceed the agreed quantity and / or is carried out according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the form of supply be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to Argentina is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year . &quot;
the association comm@@ its itself to reduce the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a sc@@ ech@@ est rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community will change the amount of Argent@@ ine trade with each new Member State under number 2 in consultation with Argentina . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the cancellation fee mentioned under number 5 is taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market developments affecting the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and Lamm@@ studi@@ ous on the Community Market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , so that the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mined by the implementation of the regulation the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will be made in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the quantities specified in this agreement , it is granted export lic@@ ences for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the Community is committed to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina depends on the template of an export licence , which is issued by the responsible position designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the distribution of the import licence for the goods in question .
&quot; in addition , in implementing provisions , the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority has given regular intervals to the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if necessary , en@@ code to the destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement shall be properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; it regularly examines the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for the goal stated under the number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will not be carried out under the agreement with collective bar@@ gaining numbers . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be eff@@ ected without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a common market organization for hammer , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ enti@@ ally important for the New Zealand economy , and that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand &apos;s meat and lamb is not affected by these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this agreement New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will ensure access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand preserves the assurance that the normal he@@ el of its amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the actual amount of the year actually executed does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the specified quantities are carried out in conventional form forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand cannot be prevented from using new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position in the community market .
&quot; should a change in the form of supply be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it ple@@ dges to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to reduce the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a sc@@ ech@@ est rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community will change in consultation with New Zealand the amounts specified in clause 2 according to the volume of New Zealand Trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import burdens for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is due to the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in clause 5 .
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and Lamm@@ studi@@ ous on the Community Market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the Regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of she@@ ep@@ skin in the community without risk for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be given to prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond that amount .
&quot; in its turn , the Community is committed to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products originating in New Zealand depends on the template of an export licence , which is given by the authority responsible by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the distribution of the import licence for the goods in question .
&quot; in addition , the regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent authority of the New Zealand authority has given regular intervals to the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if necessary , be de@@ cryp@@ ted to the destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly examines the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of the two contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will not be carried out in accordance with collective bar@@ gaining numbers following the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all the issues arising in the implementation of the agreement , which will be submitted to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall be eff@@ ected without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount stipul@@ ated in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . starting from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the year following year , the amount is set in relation to the total annual amount . &quot;

&quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance specified on the label . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , so the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the titanium is measured by ever renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analysed on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ er is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest serum fer@@ til@@ isation in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated only in volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups , and for re@@ agents of other speci@@ f@@ ity standards are developed at the time . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for determining the blood group definition of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist who is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow .
the Tit@@ er announces the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tible anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the restoration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International standard preparation or a state standards preparation in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain up to 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be preserved for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ ent form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the tests of the shelf ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 percent of its weight if it is tested by further drying on phosph@@ or pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ent or re @-@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in a flu@@ ent form or after re@@ opening , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups should not be d@@ yed arti@@ ficially , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups .
&quot; adequate samples of all given re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents may contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black printed label is to be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish , &quot;

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum is supposed to react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is determined to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals who are immun@@ ised by the Ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C an@@ tigen when the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and do not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , then the ag@@ glut@@ ination period in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be less than with the ant@@ an@@ itary antibodies . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in the A group . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells which do not contain a A @-@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is to ti@@ tr@@ ate parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ at , separated from A1 , A2 and A2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ 0.0 flow of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A2@@ B blood cells , this is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood type B. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which contain B an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells , which does not contain B an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the resur@@ rec@@ ted , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or similar comparison , with a flow of blood cells of group B to ti@@ tr@@ ate ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on a single object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ 0.0 flow of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s regulation , it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any un@@ laden human red blood cells , regardless of which blood type they belong . &quot;

&quot; whereas for Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this release falls within the jurisdiction of the Community , which is based on the Treaty by which it was founded , which has the necessary powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from the time of its entry into force , this additional protocol is part of the Convention . from that point onwards , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot;

&quot; based on the common declaration adopted by the ministers of EF@@ TA Countries and Member States of the Community as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , which includes a call to create a European economic area , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying border barriers and the country of origin , &quot;
&quot; in DER A@@ sen@@ ger that the community within the action programme has decided to strengthen the internal market , to introduce a uniform administration paper in the internal market of goods from 1 January 1988 , &quot;
&quot; it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a single administration document , &quot;
&quot; in DER A@@ vo@@ icing , that this agreement should not be interpreted in a way that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties from their obligations from other international agreements . &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single paper ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the contracting parties involved in the transport of goods between the contracting parties are authorised to use a single document , for which preliminary prints are to be used in the app@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the single paper serves as a registration or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed by the sole use of the single document ; &quot;
&quot; - asked by the participants , so that they may come to the request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention prevents the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for those involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not present at a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete application may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must be filed afterwards , with the approval of the relevant authorities in order to act as a peri@@ odic collection registration , within the deadline established by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted instead of using the consistency paper . &quot;
&quot; if the document is used , the parties with the consent of the competent authorities will be able to add common lists associated with the export and import@@ ation of all common lists , in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the for@@ warding of all goods traffic , or for sub @-@ sectors ; &quot;

&quot; ( 1 ) The registration shall be carried out in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , which is authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the for@@ warding expenses for export or shipping shall be authorised . &quot;
&quot; if applicable , the customs authority of the destination or the transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) For the purposes of this Act , the provision shall be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Sche@@ dule 1 of this Act . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the registration exempl@@ ars required for each individual section of the contract between the contracting parties , which may , if necessary , be attached to the copies required for the provision of the for@@ warding in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions relating to collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , the relevant authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the for@@ warding expenses for exports and shipping procedures will be transferred to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies provided for these for@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible , that the details contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings are identical . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth transfer of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries establish each other on request , or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The official assistance may or may be refused or refused if the sought @-@ after country of the view is that the official assistance would imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; &quot; ) or other essential interests or breach an operating , commercial or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the official assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification for the seeking country must be communicated incor@@ rectly . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country seeks official assistance , which it could not afford , if it is requested , it points to this circum@@ stance in its inquiry . &quot;
( 5 ) The information obtained after paragraph 1 may only be used for purposes of this Convention and enjoy the protection of the country &apos;s domestic law that it has received for information of this kind .
&quot; this information may only be used with the written consent of the customs authority , which has issued it , and may otherwise be used otherwise by the restrictions imposed by the authority . &quot;
( 1 ) A mixed committee is used in which each contracting party is represented in this convention .
&quot; ( 4 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall submit a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which , inter alia , regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of conferences and the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term of office . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may use sub @-@ committees and working groups that support it in its tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall have the task of managing this Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; to do so , the committee is regularly informed of the practical experience with the application of the Convention ; it addresses recommendations and summ@@ ari@@ zes in the cases of paragraph 3 decisions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The committee decides to make amendments to the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party has accepted a decision under the provis@@ o of the provision of the constitu@@ tive prerequis@@ ites , the decision if there is no date , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets the appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this agreement , whereby the need to take into account is to reduce freight for@@ warding expenses as far as possible and to bring satisfactory solutions to the problems arising from the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territories of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
( 2 ) This Convention applies also to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality of the Princip@@ ality is connected with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union contract .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this convention under compliance with a twelve @-@ month period ; the written notice must be addressed to the dep@@ osit@@ ar mentioned in Article 17 which is notified to all other parties .
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided that the Parties concluded their acceptance certificates by the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities until November 1 , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) When this Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , the first day of the second month will enter into force on the first day of the second month . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in a document in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish , and Spanish ; it is deposited in the archive of the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
&quot; I allow me to propose the following agreement , which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot;
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called the Commission , can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; in order to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related issues , and the Council will follow this wish as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . faced with the responsibility of the Commission on the management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the inventory as well as the reports of its advisory fishing committee . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission are regularly advis@@ ing on how the cooperation between the two parties is intensified , and in particular the opportunities provided by the Commission to establish a closer relationship with the advisory fishing committee of the Council . &quot;
&quot; 4 . by signing this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r and then pay annual payments . &quot;
&quot; the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings , which are conven@@ ed on special request by the Commission . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties are reviewed . &quot;
&quot; unless new provisions are agreed , the agreement extends to the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
any party at any time has the possibility of with@@ drawing from the agreement while compl@@ ying with a one @-@ year period of notice .
&quot; in terms of clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognise the observer status at meetings of the Advisory Committee on F@@ ish@@ eries Management of the Council by a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask for the Word and participate in meetings , but would not have the right to vote , nor the possibility of changing the agen@@ das of the meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform me whether these agreements are acceptable as the basis of a cooperation between your council and the community .
I assume that this letter and your answer will be the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .

the contractual partners of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for cooperation in the area of customs .
&quot; it is desirable that on the 14th of June 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ized System for the Desig@@ nation and Co@@ ding of the Goo@@ ds entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;

protocol to the 1979 Convention on large @-@ scale cre@@ ati@@ fication of air pollution in relation to the control of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ cy@@ tic flow
&quot; concerned that the current emissions of air@@ borne substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural treasures of vital importance for the environment and the economy , &quot;
&quot; remember that for the Convention on its second meeting , the executive body has recognized the need to effectively reduce the annual total emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from stationary and movable sources or its gr@@ en@@ ef@@ ish flow to 1995 , as well as the need for states that have made progress in reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide , &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their subsequent products to the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or its ramp@@ ant flow , especially by applying suitable national emission limits for new mobile larger site sources as well as retro@@ fitting existing large stationary sources , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that the scientific and technical knowledge of these questions further develop and that this development is to be taken into account in veri@@ fying the application of this protocol , and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that the formulation of a solution based on critical burdens is the creation of an effective scientific basis , which is to be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and when deciding on further internationally agreed measures , &quot;
&quot; recognizing that rapid testing of procedures to create more favourable conditions for a technology exchange will contribute to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the Commission region , &quot;
