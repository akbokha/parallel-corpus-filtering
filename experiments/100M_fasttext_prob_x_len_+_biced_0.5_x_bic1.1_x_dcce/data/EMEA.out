this document is a summary of the European Public Health Survey ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where patients can alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high @-@ spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution for inhal@@ ation or the melting tablets in patients can be applied to which the swal@@ lowing of tablets is difficult . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are also degra@@ ded as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s efficacy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two trials of 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to a placebo period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger than the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , headache , bl@@ urred vision , sp@@ as@@ iness ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , who spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid review of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued an authorization to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd. for the introduction of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s efficacy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ oni@@ ze for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or breaking treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in using Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ ine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint adoption of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; due to insufficient data security for humans and the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study more than 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled trial for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term retention period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not show medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliberate over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is used in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma retention . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ C and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ stream . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l significantly reduced the rate of recur@@ rence , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for three weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a mixed or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a mixed or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a similar proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a mixed or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion and hydro@@ xy setting of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the average Eli@@ mination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; one single dose trial in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10@@ times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in G@@ all of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in using Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled trial for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for three weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a mixed or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as a solution to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablets in healthy subjects , the relationship between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Out of this , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick check of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ oni@@ ze for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ative was greater compared to the intra@@ muscular administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly in a study where healthy volunteers were intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ ine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; at 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ um was greater compared to that after al@@ ad@@ jun@@ ct of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not show medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; observed mean improvement from initial value to P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour terminal was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who were referring to study medication was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Method of Depres@@ sions , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher rate of recur@@ rence , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a mixed or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C according to the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until the maximum plasma level was applied at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were intra@@ muscular in 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were found after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used to receive an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; only the patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival , did not make any difference between the drugs . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be applied to patients who have low levels of neutr@@ ality in the blood prior to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) noted that , unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel , Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the publication of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease , and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ p count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment can be interrupted until a recovery reaches level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate depression of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data regarding safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neutral number of neut@@ ro@@ phones has increased to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a carcin@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , male patients should be advised to undergo a sperm preservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue @-@ burning , dry mouth , pain@@ less gum , loose stools , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ eness in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , sore throat , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite fall in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant drug that promotes the cohesi@@ on of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ compos@@ ing polym@@ eri@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ activity and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved transc@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the alb@@ um@@ bing protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ enter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a 3 @-@ week mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during treatment .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or turn@@ out binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ flow bottle . &quot;
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the flow flas@@ k should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot;
then the flow flas@@ k should be swi@@ vel@@ ed and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done .

member states must ensure that the owner of the approval for the market launch has provided medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training bro@@ uch@@ ure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . &quot;
&quot; this means that se@@ amed of a biological drug is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medical drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood protein values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with se@@ amed guards must be taken under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases indicated by the medicine .
&quot; in case of patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to have a blood @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ sen@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received an appropriate instruction . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are controlled before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ inal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
se@@ amed was compared to a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by ren@@ al problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study investigating the effects of se@@ amed se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an an@@ a@@ emia caused by ren@@ al problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were held to the same degree as those who continue receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mi@@ gra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this will not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces se@@ amed products will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the transport of se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements for adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned larger operational procedures ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood Ab@@ y@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that could not take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical condition and condition of the disease . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s evaluation of the individual clinical condition and condition of disease is necessary . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te amounts to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the initial value is a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ us 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively present 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ ster ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stu@@ en@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in cases of severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the cardi@@ ologic or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with recently entered cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um@@ intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid value , taking into account an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be detected for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations in Section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the dose of epo@@ e@@ tics when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration needed to control the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in intake should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ sed cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations in Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in case of tumour patients suffering from chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients that may have to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment based on the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial dietary value of &gt; 13 g / dl there may be an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival and reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had been returned when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common adverse event during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ars ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
&quot; irrespective of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular basic disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in proportion to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not influence the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 Mam@@ ma@@ carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ st , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ clari@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis over the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximately the 20@@ s of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat@@ ter body weight , dela@@ ying the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are known for the clinical situation but of uncertain significance . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store se@@ amed out for a period of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations in Section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in intake should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in receipt of new information that could have an impact on current safety specifications , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days of achieving an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • following invitation by E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • if you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood counts , which is reg@@ ressed during further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will conduct regular blood tests in order to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , resolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with se@@ amed before starting treatment . &quot;
it was very rare to report ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) .

&quot; therefore , secre@@ tion must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed , until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , the treatment of blood @-@ poverty with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ y@@ amed can act like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , check out the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia and treat it accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;

&quot; if you take c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with se@@ amed , your doctor may determine certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle bones ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like with the H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cla@@ sta is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the agent in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8,000 elderly women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied for a period of up to five years .
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks the bone substance ) again norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to patients with placebo ( without o@@ steopor@@ osis ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients taking placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and for breast @-@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking back medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for treating the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get . &quot;
following a treatment by Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. is recommended oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this patient population is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are lacking for safety and efficacy .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental treatment , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney dysfunction , which has been associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the changes in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced ren@@ al function were similar in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years compared to the placebo group and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta over 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the oral area has been covered , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections , including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
&quot; 7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients participated in o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the jaw area with an A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and above had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh area by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) a year after the third annual dose of bone sampling from the pel@@ vic crest were taken .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to placebo .
&quot; bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ ope ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ alities were 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times .
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total income and 4.3 % on the aggregate neck . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the yearly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate compared to intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain reli@@ ance was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , in the mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose independent . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma gas rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal removal time t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early part phases ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values above ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; total Body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; reduced clearance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , material @-@ changing inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
&quot; since there are limited data for severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; with studies in dogs single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al influencing . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was determined by dosage of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulative expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure were toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontan@@ ous in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to lower serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP guidelines for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a substance which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease of Pa@@ get of bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is done too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by re @-@ norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus once again gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , one of which is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drinks , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to take A@@ cla@@ sta administration two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low during the time after the in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before completing the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the completion of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; headache , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , sleep@@ iness , ting@@ ling , sleep@@ iness , stomach upset , headache , pain in the eyes , pain , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , irritation , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent sor@@ eness and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are advised to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic prescribed , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies have been conducted to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on smoking cess@@ ation showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this area was difficult to estimate . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts to a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; medicines used in patients who require it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the AR@@ Z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also contain one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case prev@@ ails the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons are indicated that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately bring medical advice if these symptoms arise .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been adequately shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

&quot; 5.3 Non @-@ clinical data on the safety of un@@ desirable effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic range were considered as potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress , such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on fertility or cycle disturbances were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats to pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; in addition , it can be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; the studies have measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional offering of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional offering of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos will serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and incre@@ mentally increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiac pac@@ ed study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease has been performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in the report on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ch@@ iness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one should continue , should be led to the screening of the laboratory parameters from the clinical evaluation . &quot;
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
&quot; as a result of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the middle hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients talk about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological statement should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the estimated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is to be treated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies to investigate interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ do@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces the resulting hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from present data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as they are also observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege had more than three times the upper limit of the normal range , compared with placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing macro@@ vascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or .
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , but more often if pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days showed no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one seems to work on the activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ lo@@ ci@@ dal as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ lo@@ ci@@ dal ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization was random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to only receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin doses in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ lo@@ ci@@ dal resulted in total plasma matri@@ ces and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on , while values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ lo@@ ci@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de in addition to the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral treatment , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the highest concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ do@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ zes ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma removal time of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 to 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies included mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces the absorption of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat induc@@ es increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( male and female rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the estimated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ lo@@ ci@@ dal were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels in addition to the effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; although the study was missing the target with regard to their primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risk is associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and from over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de in addition to the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired .

&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror that indicated that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane doses may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed from the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the introduction of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensive insulin therapy , can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always after other medicines taken by them . &quot;

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a one @-@ wei@@ ghted auxiliary person or given by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed absorption .
a number of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by spl@@ itting is active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;

&quot; F H@@ old the Flex@@ P@@ en with the injection needle upwards and knock a few times with the finger gently against the cartridge , so that existing bubbles accumulate in the cartridge at the top . &quot;
&quot; the dose can be corrected both upwards and down , by turning the dose selection button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is opposite to the dose of the dose . &quot;
&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or plaster k@@ not ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; ) or plaster k@@ not ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there is still a chance of sei@@ zur@@ es ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ omas do not use any other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80@@ mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients receiving a daily 120 mg daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the medical history known or currently present gi@@ mmi@@ cks and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum res@@ aw rate is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be contem@@ plated on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing medications , it can result in acute arthritis during treatment , because , by lowering serum levels of serum , ur@@ inary acid deposits can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is to increase so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during clinical trials of phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ y treatment and in the course of clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ess tin has not been carried out any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( a hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous adoption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250@@ mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ ite / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active agent used at the same time .
&quot; in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a zinc oxide , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction in the C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be concluded on the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the fet@@ us / new@@ born health .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis disorder and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lesser frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ not@@ ic , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin les@@ ions , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein uria , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , decrease in blood cell count , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the reaction process Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is an effective non @-@ Pur@@ in selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition that lies beneath the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum content &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering of serum levels at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and continued to maintain throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum levels in patients , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of serum levels at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out delay ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the gi@@ ants , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the pla@@ id marks up to 24 months . &quot;
increased SH@@ A values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ X ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose proportional increase .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ X amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum concentration in serum ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is within the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant via the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ changing F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function function .
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) , the C@@ MA@@ X and AU@@ C from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly in comparison to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impaired fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , at about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4.1 times of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by lowering the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ echnik and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human@@ istic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ ite / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active agent used at the same time .
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport company has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is described as in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , ready before the medicine is brought into circulation , and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is to be presented according to CH@@ MP guidelines on risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information exists , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days following the achievement of important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of the crystal is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is reached . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C ingredients .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have or had a cardiac weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • if you are treated because of a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
&quot; if at the moment you have a g@@ out attack ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cl@@ utter@@ ed before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use drugs that contain one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . &quot;
no studies have been carried out on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on transport and the ability to operate machinery .
please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
the individual week@@ days are printed on the back of the bli@@ ster pack so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .
&quot; if you have in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently taken an over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the taking of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , take it as soon as possible unless the next intake is short . &quot;
&quot; if you break the dose of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can increase again , and your discomfort can wor@@ sen because new urine crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their environment . &quot;
&quot; common side effects ( more than 1 of 100 treatment , but less than 1 of 10 treatment ) : • Rec@@ ei@@ ving liver test results • diar@@ rhe@@ a • headache • rash • nausea &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required for the prevention of bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( stomach problems ) , written ab@@ domin@@ es ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as acid sho@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit at least 30 minutes long . &quot;

&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or medication ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day that is to take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ropes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible adverse reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ ast@@ ral pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , following the occurrence of symptoms , which point to a malign@@ ant irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available which indicate whether or not the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients needing a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but keep the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated appropriately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly damaging effects in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but also for o@@ steopor@@ osis .
&quot; however , decreases of serum calcium to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ osis . &quot;

al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s therapeutic equ@@ ability once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and the Fra@@ k@@ tur intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the average incl@@ ination of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo was 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on fem@@ ur h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the trough . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus Pla@@ z@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the stimulation of BM@@ D from the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new cycl@@ one cont@@ our by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate at women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before taking a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) showed no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed in soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;

after IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min .
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the elimination of other drugs by these transport systems in humans . &quot;

&quot; in the treatment of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 48 hours 2.4 % , in the F@@ ä@@ ces after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones is expected ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ aches , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) as well as in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ arded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on orange cartridge bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; form@@ ulations of the formulation and the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and corresponding dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood level provisions ( see below )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both ni@@ b and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus seb@@ um are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ graf@@ ting phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ ph can dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed to take oral contrac@@ tions in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advancement therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adap@@ tations can later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after transplan@@ tation in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f . should a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules be converted to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , this change@@ over has to be done in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose . &quot;
&quot; after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
heart transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day a day to take in the morning .
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ - , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage Adju@@ st@@ ments in special patient populations patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the desired area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
&quot; since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , patients with reduced ren@@ al function , since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol , a calculation of the cre@@ atine inc@@ lear@@ ance and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In case of switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of full @-@ blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ esis controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform common checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood pressure levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ is@@ Adap@@ tation , Chan@@ ges of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose can take several days until the steady state has entered . &quot;
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the bottom blood of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ man@@ t in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually within the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with cardiac and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or hyper@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; form@@ ulations of the formulation and the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recep@@ tions in childhood , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may cause a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical mal@@ functions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution is offered in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently increase or lower the blood parameters of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while supple@@ menting substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive reci@@ pro@@ cal effect was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal ob@@ struction . &quot;
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used for acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduces the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , thus increasing hormone exposure , making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures is particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not provide a indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course of pregnancy and the result of pregnancy .
&quot; in the case of uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ cal@@ emia ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not precisely determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare (

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
&quot; cases of non @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell inn@@ ern .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
&quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0,@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) died in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ ph and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , in 6@@ 67 of nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) died . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % Con@@ fi@@ dence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ agra@@ ph vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % Con@@ fi@@ dence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ ance Arm 3 ( men ) , in Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) deaths occur . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal gra@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ tation were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was applied to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis above literature , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus occurred in 2@@ 1,7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients treated by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients at the same time as a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t based on a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired bottom level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal gra@@ fts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower starting doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to Tal@@ esis between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ ted by transplan@@ ts ( Abu @-@ El@@ lip@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ o @-@ value and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism , induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , are to be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs through bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform common checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical mal@@ functions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

&quot; in total 34 patients of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in were converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , whereas only 6 Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients needed another therapy ( Bech@@ stein et al . , Transplan@@ tation 2004 ; 77 : 12@@ 21 ) . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a blood coag@@ ulation caused by the deficiency of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application will depend on whether adv@@ a is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; lawyer is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain any protein or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tics with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advances may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted its approval to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transport of Adv@@ ances across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment course , adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis On long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor of VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed of administration should be determined after the patient has been treated , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the amount of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure time is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and am@@ n@@ esi@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ter@@ ti@@ ary ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience of using factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s reported in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day . &quot;
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) demonstrated a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should request another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited formally announced the approval of the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ wom@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself , so that there can be no infection in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re@@ generate the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; if the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ fem@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently proven that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the recovery has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Com@@ preh@@ ensive Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed , that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main activity measurements were the severity of the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , apart from the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported about a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , patients under aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , anor@@ ex@@ ia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ rel ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients with hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the transport of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the absence of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time during long @-@ term use . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ os@@ am@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , hy@@ phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data are not enough to give appropriate recommendations for dosing .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not examined in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not enough to prescri@@ be appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is to be cancelled at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce it to its extent . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the context of clinical trials with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ os@@ ols during pregnancy is not secured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of de@@ formi@@ ties compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , there may be a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mi@@ ction , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , depression , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage may cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effects , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four test persons were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine following the sole use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to an aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorization application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • nausea and head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medication . &quot;
transport and the use of machines For application in recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ os@@ ol leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , you should immediately notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat ache , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , ti@@ redness , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves erup@@ tion and swelling ) or skin rash were reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach problems , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation , and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver inflammation has also very rarely been reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ml ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ath for inser@@ tion ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and efficiency on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ tion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of ap@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptom ratio ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ rel , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the interven@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous clinical course and may be stopped after the symptoms have been stopped and resum@@ ed .
&quot; in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses ranging from up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , which was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
in a single dose study with adults Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology of different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms except for the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant accumulation following a daily application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose dose of 7.5 mg in a dose of 7.5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ der@@ less , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ mine 400 ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ dri@@ b@@ less , mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years may be caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher level of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children that are normal to met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ ic in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials of adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the disaster adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor disability . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance loss , nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ X about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation following a daily application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .
&quot; 12 Sever@@ al single dose studies showed that , in pedi@@ atric patients , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients with recommended doses , with those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ glass bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene inter@@ connecting cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to inhal@@ e once a day , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats can be removed for inser@@ tion without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study comparing patients with general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets once daily put into the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to the det@@ ach formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined on pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x of A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for intake while food T@@ max of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extends from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours .

the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical sc@@ oring tests for the melt tablet showed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical application .
the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that are limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children that are normal to met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
&quot; this medication contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ ol@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group , similar to the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; small children between 6 and 23 months were the most common side effects reported more often than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no adverse events were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution . &quot;
&quot; at recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for inhal@@ ation contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients in recommended doses with those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a stem of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from person to person , because people have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) was cleaned up , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; re@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor insp@@ ected what anti@@ viral drugs the patient had previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ yl@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system &apos;s damage and therefore also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was tested in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , with a low dose rate , was compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used earlier prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentration of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the viral load change after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ viol@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medication A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients who received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ cin@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded as well as as@@ ce@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( the death of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the recovered immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of ammon@@ ium avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ ium as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the reinfor@@ cing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ par@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use with children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width , and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pling avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
normally A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe h@@ ep@@ atic side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with pre@@ existing liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides , which are confused with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous dose of ast@@ er@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to the reduced plasma levels of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for pi@@ vot@@ al symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ oz@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col in the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated for children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses associated with medication that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with low therapeu@@ tical width is not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeu@@ tical width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active agents are mainly metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of ammon@@ ium can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already taken St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ rate below ) .
&quot; in contrast to C@@ MA@@ X , 50@@ 8 % is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pling avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acids component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pling avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pling avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may be drow@@ ned by the serum concentration of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ ands . &quot;
caution is advised when these drugs are applied together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
&quot; the simultaneous gift of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the plasma cutting of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of 200 mg of Fos@@ am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ PCR ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with ather@@ ase .
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase because it can cause resor@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of ammon@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ ase at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended using am@@ pling avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous dose of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while cau@@ tious with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma cutting of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am in the 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for pi@@ vot@@ al symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ oz@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to be adjusted when Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous dosing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended as well . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether or not am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reduction in the 12 body weight in seed showed a reduction in gravi@@ d rats , which were administered by the ni@@ dation into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernity unit . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment termination . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ a or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ tate and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as performed under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and bilateral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ dic fat accumulation ( bull ) . &quot;
only one case ( bull ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral individuals who had been treated with am@@ pling avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine .
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s occurred in 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pling avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose ri@@ k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received ast@@ er@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary supporting measures can be initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral gene and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ sions with the result of a formation of im@@ mature , non infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ entri@@ cation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ranges from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pling avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients , which received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I / M / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) , patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed more than 96 weeks in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) An@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 5@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / S / S / T / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / F / S / F / S / F / S / S / F / S / S / F / S / F / S / S / F / S / F / S / S / F / S / S
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pling avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ cin@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ ing@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pling avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ obil avi@@ r ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ob@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ar avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study conducted with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study . &quot;
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ sub@@ ordination of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ slip wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 was pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ X , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pling avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the concur@@ rent food intake influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of in@@ bound ampl@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound an@@ hy@@ dri@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ X , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or be a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily ammon@@ ium exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , A@@ gener@@ ase and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ a@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pling avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas appeared in male animals , which were consistent with 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of treatment . &quot;
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pling avi@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the reinfor@@ cing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ par@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in the long run . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
&quot; in contrast to C@@ MA@@ X , 50@@ 8 % is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pling avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pling avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is advised when these drugs are applied together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous dosing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ rone ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ dation into the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during po@@ sterity . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary supporting measures can be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ entri@@ cation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ranges from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound an@@ hy@@ dri@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or be a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pling avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas performed in male animals , which were consistent with 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of the h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical application , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of this findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pling avi@@ r .
&quot; these results indicate that the metabol@@ isation routes are not yet fully mature in young , so that am@@ pling cavi@@ ar or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over . &quot;
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting was not documented in patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ ium as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for the A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion and low dose @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ bos is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ory of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
&quot; in contrast to C@@ MA@@ X , 50@@ 8 % is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pling avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , a significantly higher plasma concentrations of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am are expected after oral dosing of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to inhal@@ ation may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether or not am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in seed showed a reduction in gravi@@ d rats , which were administered by the inv@@ oc@@ ation to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ a or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;

&quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness , vom@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be a serious nature and force you to stop taking this drug . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss in legs , arms , and face , fat gain in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat loss in the neck ( &quot; &quot; bull &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of skin , so that it lasts for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) in all studies . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the placebo group treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or accept@@ ability of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine can continue until all visible signs have disappeared in the genital or peripheral areas , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , a different treatment should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is left out , the patient may apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area to be submitted until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease should take place . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus host reaction should be observed . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily occur@@ ren@@ ces were performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ tur to be circumcised were observed . &quot;
&quot; when applying an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher doses than recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation were observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral areas has not yet been clinical experience .
&quot; although limited data points to an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in relation to the disposal of the cow@@ or@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm by the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during the therapy or the reactions form after the end of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as there is currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapeutic forms should be considered in super@@ inten@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have any clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of responding to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treating ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis on anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause a lot of discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have not been achieved , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly shared and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the cow@@ or@@ kers ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects , complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of the phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common adverse event , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in connection with the application , were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream are listed below .
&quot; this assessment of the clinical signs indicated according to the review shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , it often occurred to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / fl@@ yers ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review schedule fores@@ een assessment of the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe scar@@ ring and cal@@ ming ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for treatment of ac@@ tin kerat@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; accidental intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid supply . &quot;
&quot; after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior in the treatment of an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 60 % of the patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super @-@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications for external anti @-@ ageing , ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis and super @-@ biological bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0,1 , 0,2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that after topical application I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin from patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application also revealed no similar effects in mice . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in mice at three days per week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only possesses low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for people to look at as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may hurt other people even though these have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if it remains untreated , it may lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who have been exposed to the sun during their lifetime . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in the face and scal@@ p of patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances , which help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis , or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please notify your doctor before starting treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream only when the area to be treated is cured after a previous drug or operative treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of unexpected contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o W@@ enden the cream not in@@ wardly . o Use the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a band@@ age band@@ . o If reactions occur in the treated area that give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cl@@ utter@@ ed , you can continue treatment . o In@@ form your doctor if they have no normal blood picture &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties in re@@ traction of the fores@@ kin can be expected with increased incidence of skin les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medicine for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with genital war@@ ts , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is following the sexual intercourse ( not before ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
do not breast@@ feed your infant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different for cow@@ or@@ kers , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the spi@@ ked war@@ ts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
men with til@@ ting under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin each day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream 5 days a week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable during the Al@@ dar@@ a cream application .
&quot; if your skin responds to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells may make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain faster or cause fatigue .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , there are lighter skin reactions which disappear within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application site ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sc@@ oring , skin disorder , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application site ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , skin irritation , swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , lim@@ b pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effectiveness in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary if necessary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted granting Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient we@@ ars this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any associated side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , specially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase III study , it is expected that almost all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually form within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ ti@@ ously after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ thon ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) and reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not directly or indirectly affect pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase above breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their el@@ ong@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older , are listed according to the following frequency : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory stagn@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , it came to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ian version within 3 months ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in whom there was never a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study involving the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients had the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account using a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five effectiveness variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally observed in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental develop@@ mental speed after the Z @-@ score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form indicated a normal mental development velocity , whereas in older patients with severe delay @-@ form only limited or no progress could be observed in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may be a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the approval for the in@@ verse has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will take long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which split certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction has occurred on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction is any side effect occurring during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please notify your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain , because a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
advice on handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate of the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient we@@ ars this , gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory stagn@@ ation and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( appearance in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Elev@@ ated pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the package supplement will be updated . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta prolonged survival times than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an authorization to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union . &quot;
every pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ alized advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce incidence and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients also need to receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking the an@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients do not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value prior to treatment &quot;
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of doses a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or then continues in the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials do not indicate that in patients aged 65 years of age or more than 65 years of age there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data regarding safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which exceed the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ines and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutral number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy .
&quot; all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , premature blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course to obtain advice regarding the conservation of semen . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b exist , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected when used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the locking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is transferred into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; frequency indications : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on available data of spontan@@ eity ) . &quot;
&quot; * * * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , taste disturbances and hair loss should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2 . &quot;
&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined regarding the inclusion of all events in which the consul@@ ted doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients , which were random@@ ized to receiving c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;

* * Cover to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) hair loss should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2 .
&quot; for this table a threshold of 5 % was defined regarding the recording of all events , in which the report doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for possible . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients , which were random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 mixed mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy ( n = 16@@ 4 ) phase 2 similar to the phase 3 P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine protein ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these sub@@ types are likely to result in differences in patient populations as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSCLC , which were random@@ ized to receiving c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine in 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined for the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of the patients who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed were :
&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinics with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , sometimes fatal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and typ@@ ho@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis . &quot;
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple attacks by blocking the thym@@ us dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural les@@ ions , showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients treated with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural les@@ ions was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

&quot; analysis of the impact of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival demonstrated clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = repository @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total context interval for HR ( = hazard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ inferior limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin require less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients also needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0,@@ 00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ions over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly dischar@@ ged in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found unchanged within 24 hours of application in the urine . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has an overall length of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

&quot; dissolve the content of the 100 mg capsule with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , which results in a solution with a conc@@ ession of approximately 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the content of the 500 mg capsule with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , which results in a solution with a conc@@ ession of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;
&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the product . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in obes@@ e adults with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and do not have any weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , thereby causing around a quarter of the fats covered with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg after one year recorded an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss was observed for patients .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stools , stools , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , discharge o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( F@@ ä@@ ces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied to patients treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be applied to children and adolescents under 18 , since there are not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , the dosage is not necessary for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as drugs against high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures , in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed . &quot;
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years in clinical trials , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene were found in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the offering of a single dose of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as absorption of taken fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size . &quot;
it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a quick reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ene rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , blocked absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ critical , o@@ ily @-@ reduced diets . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies , weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin amounted to or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline : 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable for 8 hours following the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be demonstrated spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was administered to the minimal systemic resor@@ ption dose , two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ne ) and M3 ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ forming leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for the transport must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 , is described as in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment , as at this time you might have not consistently reduced the fat content in the diet . &quot;
&quot; learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions , which you usually take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a rich dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
keep out of the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to stay healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as indication on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum of a day . &quot;
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; which quantity is appropriate for you , refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of mal@@ nour@@ ished accompanying symptoms . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously , approximately 0.5 kg a week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you only get up to 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30 to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to it . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and o@@ ily fragran@@ ces and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ ha is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a medicine which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ ha was examined in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with al@@ chem@@ ia in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd , for the introduction of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ ha is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon massage , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute idi@@ otic after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is recommended in the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ ha is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumours directed against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population was shown that the simultaneous adoption of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , k@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , ser@@ tral@@ ine , and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for use of p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events ( 6@@ 33 patients ) were most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams , which could at least be related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to observe . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an Alo@@ e over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , given on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials to indicate chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the associated effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After IV dosage follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ X ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer was 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached the same value as measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ X was higher after the one @-@ time equivalent of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found again within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal removal time and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence indicates that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the action duration . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and because Alo@@ is is intended for unique use in humans , the relevance of these results is low for humans . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended to treat hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should be similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; &quot; reference medical drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage is damaged , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are in the blood ab@@ norm . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment had been applied to the medication ( i.e. , no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data for the stability of the drug and the marketed drug do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease worsen@@ ed in more patients than with the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ stac@@ ea ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go may be used for nine months at the age of nine , but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ utter@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo said on the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together by skin dogs , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common adverse event associated with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation on the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; may 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the transport of alt@@ ar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection will begin . &quot;
it is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected surface wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral dosage and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have used Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side effect irritation at the location which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ tide dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; by binding on this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s and bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least appears question@@ able at least some infection forms , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied on intact skin for up to 7 days under occ@@ lu@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adults between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans was reduced by 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive h@@ ep@@ atic and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure of up to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin : &quot;

&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is made from sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation , and ensures that the vacc@@ ination of two doses can be completed . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix offers the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adult , approved since 1996 , and the vacc@@ inated twin rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are given within the framework of one of three doses existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ et adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix suffered from 98 to 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain in the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals for the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a cra@@ ck@@ ling vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection simp@@ eds , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the basic di@@ mm@@ ation , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can , however , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever compared with the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ based vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ iness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; statisti@@ cally , the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of formal in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , which were performed in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum levels for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ atorial simp@@ lex with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the 3 @-@ tin vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month following completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units formed of formally in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time in the second year of life at the same time with the creation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined m@@ um@@ my m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults demonstrated similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
&quot; the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ el@@ ding , on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes . &quot;
&quot; according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the amended version is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in polluted waters . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms which may possibly require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a high level of protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ inations , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he / your child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
&quot; the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose , and will give you / your child a vaccine against completion of the vacc@@ ination series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes ambient rix is inj@@ ected for persons suffering from severe blood coag@@ ulation problems , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child undergo / undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take further medicine ( including those that you can &apos;t get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or is planned for immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both H@@ CV A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as diverse as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or nursing women , unless it is urgently needed that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the scheduled date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the first approval for the market launch , the CH@@ MP under@@ took the view that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with a complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps - split into several single doses of the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ eed was not able to compare with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ eed can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ eed in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; Am@@ mon@@ eed was approved because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was used . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for the use in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated according to the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ha@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it was a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal increase and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of dys@@ functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least an adverse event ( AE ) occurred and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosing occurred with a 5 @-@ month old infant with an acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine on phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues in the first year of life .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ nit@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ha@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism , and with repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined . &quot;
&quot; following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was detected in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ lic acid ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat did not contain any compla@@ ined effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ha@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen is produced for each gram between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined . &quot;
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient can keep the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are using laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine can pass into the mother &apos;s milk and damage your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , follow @-@ up of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice one of these symptoms in yourself , immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , discomfort , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
they are not allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box and the container according to the date of the exp@@ iry date indicated .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and the contents of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS packaging are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
&quot; 30 If your laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS or@@ ally on same individual doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measure of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in the sole dose or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the use of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vou@@ ro@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) with an emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a stroke of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt connection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single dose of bol@@ us angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT is shortened after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be taken . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bol@@ us dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din vs. ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds is to admini@@ ster a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg and re @-@ examine the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt .
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous application of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low molecular forces .
• Eff@@ ective hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; during treatment , the patients are carefully monitored with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding may occur everywhere during treatment . &quot;
patients who take war@@ far@@ in and be treated with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should consider monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is once again achieved prior to the treatment .
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when combined with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly controlled . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ fle@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of fixation , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ al@@ isations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , it occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and there@@ with its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , serum induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) caused a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ valve should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) are presented in Table 10 . &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ fle@@ c@@ ine were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
&quot; it is expected that as a pe@@ p@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ am@@ ine is a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid parts with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body pool . &quot;
&quot; the primary metabol@@ ite , which results from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
the elimination is performed in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals during repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 cases of the clinical st@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was restricted to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .
adverse events following a longer @-@ term physiological burden as a reaction to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic coag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to that in clinical application even at very much higher dosage .

angi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single doses of type 1 glass to 10 ml which is sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stop@@ per and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes is given into a pier@@ cing bottle of angi@@ ox and slightly wa@@ ved until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear .
5 ml are taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot effectively process .
&quot; insulin no@@ is@@ ine is very slightly different from insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot effectively process insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ p . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted its approval to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or apply sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal muscles . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin availability , the need for insulin in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active force , the brand ( producer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the need for insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dose or abor@@ tion , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ o @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ amide and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics like beta @-@ block@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din , and reserve , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be allevi@@ ated or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is occurs in the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk or is resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed in clinical trials , classified according to system categories and classified according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously change the injection area within the injection area may result in a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ co@@ lic injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs faster and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with a normal insulin .
&quot; in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ a in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ giving effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a double so fast effect of action as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ dropping effect about 2 hours earlier than insulin @-@ insulin .
&quot; it was obvious that in an application of is@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ den@@ oun@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin was obtained in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ ulate control than with normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if an insulin dose is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as in the case of a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is given 2 minutes before the meal begins ( Figure 1A ) before the meal begins ( Figure 1A ) and compared to normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin no@@ od@@ ine at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
