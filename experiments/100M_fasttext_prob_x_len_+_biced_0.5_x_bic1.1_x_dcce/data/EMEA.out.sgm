<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Survey (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluates the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your disease or its treatment, please read the package supplement (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental disorder where patients can alternate manic episodes (periods of anorexic high-spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems if oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution for inhalation or the melting tablets in patients can be applied to which the swallowing of tablets is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are also degraded as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abilify's efficacy to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two trials of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared to a placebo period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the patient's symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo to alleviate the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (dizziness), headache, blurred vision, spasiness (drowsiness), nausea and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, who spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid review of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued an authorization to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the introduction of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">Abilify's efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predisponize for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of Dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, consider reducing the dose or breaking treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis, or in states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related adverse events in using Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist famotine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAX remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in case of CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 Extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint adoption of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"doses of 10-30 mg of aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates, 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data security for humans and the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study more than 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"in a controlled trial for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term retention period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not show medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdoses with Aripiprazl were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of haemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is used in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazl has a high plasma retention."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2C and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the Nucleus caudatus and on the putstream."</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study 52 the proportion of responder patients who retained a response to study medication was similar in both groups (aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery depression rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl significantly reduced the rate of recurrence, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg in an average weight of ca.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled trial for three weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a mixed or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a mixed or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazl showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a mixed or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse to the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion and hydroxy setting of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">"the average Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites via CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydro aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"one single dose trial in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and dehydro aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for human beings."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in Gall of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility."</seg>
<seg id="99">"in rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the average Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose."</seg>

<seg id="2217">"according to the review schedule foreseen assessment of the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream, it was very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too severe scarring and calming (19%)."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"in clinical trials for the treatment of Imiquimine for treatment of actin keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"accidental intake of 200 mg Imiquimine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"the clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid supply."</seg>
<seg id="2221">"after topical application of Imiquimodine, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected in a pharmacokinetic investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"in 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was clearly superior in the treatment of an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"in the case of 60% of the patients with Imiquimod, patients treated with Imiquimodine completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):"</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary super-specific basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"Imiquimine's efficacy in three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non hypertrophic acne lesions within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the unhairy scalp or face."</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the approved indications for external anti-ageing, actin keratosis and super-biological basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313)."</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actin keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0,1, 0,2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags)."</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life time after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that after topical application Imiquimodine was low on MC-diseased skin from patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with actin keratosis or superficient basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">"in a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study for the dermal application also revealed no similar effects in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice in mice at three days per week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">"the appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only possesses low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for people to look at as very low due to systemic exposure."</seg>
<seg id="2241">"the tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR."</seg>

<seg id="2277">"in the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effectiveness in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver)."</seg>
<seg id="2278">"in children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2279">"the most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, fever and reactions to the infusion site."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills."</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">"each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, and if necessary update this summary if necessary."</seg>

<seg id="2288">"the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient wears this, can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h."</seg>
<seg id="2289">"the safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"the safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients."</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with durazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any associated side effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">"for this reason, specially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"due to the clinical phase III study, it is expected that almost all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase usually form within 3 months from the beginning of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with care when using aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">"since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautiously cautiously after an interruption of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or anti-python) to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"in case of a slight or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"in case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2303">"as there is no data in newborns exposed to larvonidase above breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme."</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">"adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their elongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older, are listed according to the following frequency: very often (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory stagnation and facial edema (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"children Undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe follow-up and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table."</seg>

<seg id="2309">"in most patients, within 3 months after the onset of the treatment, it came to a Seroconian version within 3 months (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older)."</seg>
<seg id="2310">"up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to an early excretion from the study), no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients, in whom there was never a Serokonversion."</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzymatic therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"after IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"although patients were recruited for the study involving the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients had the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype."</seg>

<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"from the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly prior to treatment, 22 (85%) had a normal liver size until the end of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"within the first 4 weeks, a significant drop in the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"with regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account using a combined repository, the clinically significant changes across five effectiveness variables (expected percentage normal FEV, range in the 6-minute hearing test, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally observed in 10 patients (22%) and a decrease in 9 patients (20%)."</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">"in four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in Harn in week 22."</seg>
<seg id="2329">"in several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) found a normal mental developmental speed after the Z-score (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form indicated a normal mental development velocity, whereas in older patients with severe delay-form only limited or no progress could be observed in cognitive development."</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately etogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials to indicate chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the associated effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular De- and Repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV dosage follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAX) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured at 11 testicular cancer was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron, total texposition (AUC0- ∞) reached the same value as measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAX was higher after the one-time equivalent of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">"elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found again within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous Bolusinjektion the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal removal time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical trials, effects were only observed after expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 out of preclinical studies, evidence indicates that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular De- and Repolarisation and can extend the action duration."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal cord) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice."</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended to treat hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should be similar to a biological drug called Roferon-A, which is already approved in the EU (also known as" "reference medical drug" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>

<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheleon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment had been applied to the medication (i.e., no signs of the virus in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data for the stability of the drug and the marketed drug do not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease worsened in more patients than with the reference drug, and Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from that, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crustacea) and small infected infirmations (crack or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not work against this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo may be used for nine months at the age of nine, but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cluttered after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo said on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together by skin dogs, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissues) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse event associated with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation on the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"may 2007, the European Commission granted the Company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of sensitization or severe local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection will begin."</seg>
<seg id="2687">It is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retinamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2-3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after topical application on skimmed skin or infected surface wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin E C (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skimmed skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral dosage and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the treatment with Altargo should be continued is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have used Altargo, was the most frequently reported side effect irritation at the location which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptide dyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s and bosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of reapamulin at least appears questionable at least some infection forms, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the case of non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied on intact skin for up to 7 days under occlusion."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization, and ensures that the vaccination of two doses can be completed."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body) as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix offers the same components as the vaccine Twinrix adult, approved since 1996, and the vaccinated twin rix children since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adult and Twinrix children are given within the framework of one of three doses existing vaccination plan."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because ambirix and Twinet adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix suffered from 98 to 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain in the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) and irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambirix may not be applied in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals for the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for prioritizing with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination, need a crackling vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection simpeds, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formal inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after the basic dimmation, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since an intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impact success, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in thrombocytopenia or blood coagulation disorders, Ambirix can, however, be injected subcutaneous as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot effectively process.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin noisine is very slightly different from insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting insulin insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot effectively process insulin, Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisp."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted its approval to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or apply subcutaneously through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal muscles."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin availability, the need for insulin in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active force, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the need for insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dose or abortion, in particular in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"the time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used, and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme."</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias are oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disco-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salicamide and sulfonamide antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympatholytics like beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin, and reserve, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be alleviated or absent."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-lulis occurs in the human mother's milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk or is resorbed after oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"the following are listed in clinical trials, classified according to system categories and classified according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously change the injection area within the injection area may result in a Lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous dose of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucolic injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin occurs faster and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with a normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin-lulis showed a proportional amount of glucosa in the therapeutically relevant dosage range of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosa-giving effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has a double so fast effect of action as normal human insulin and achieves complete glucosesdropping effect about 2 hours earlier than insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"it was obvious that in an application of isulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-denounal glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"in 2 minutes before the meal, insulin was obtained in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postulate control than with normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if an insulin dose is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as in the case of a human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
