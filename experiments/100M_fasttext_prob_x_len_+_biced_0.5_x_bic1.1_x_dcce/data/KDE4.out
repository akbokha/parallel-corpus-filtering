&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . in spite of their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the box tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of default setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module view filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras overview filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : no element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , you can easily detect large files , even then easily if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the sh@@ ading depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is available at all , only if there is enough room for displaying or whether the area is used by subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be maintained that the surface area is proportional to the size of the entry . it is not always respected in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View . it is used frames to show the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame needs space that is then lost to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions . &quot;
&quot; instead , a spac@@ ed pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to specify the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option pictures per line has a slider and a rotation box to set the number of thumb@@ nails each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box , display the file name of the image , determine if the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify if the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up the sub@@ folders with a slider or a swi@@ vel field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box , you can copy original pictures to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for thumb@@ nail pictures than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provide easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML @-@ settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation pane , or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the default browser recognition of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly using this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
the module website can be checked in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras website . you can check the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML , check if your &amp; HTML ; document the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches , all found bugs will be displayed . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are displayed by all browsers correctly . &quot;
allows you to review your CSS ; style sheets that are embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used .
&quot; check the links on your site for for@@ warding and faulty short@@ cuts . recur@@ sively , all links are checked on the website . &quot;
here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
&quot; with the module Web Archi@@ ver for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , you can save web pages with text and images in .@@ html format . &quot;
&quot; click the mouse on the Tools page , and a dialog appears to save the displayed webpage . &quot;

&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam . &quot;
&quot; you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; edited ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&quot; if you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to give you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then let us ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to report in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam . .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ cam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; edited ; will additionally use as an al@@ ren@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as base folder . &amp; edited ; views any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up and digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word playlist to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera so it can handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported tube cameras in the Help menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distri@@ bu@@ tive software collection for digital cameras that support an ever @-@ increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communicating with the machine . since photos are generally large files and are slow to transfer over the serial port , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably by digi@@ cam . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may see thumb@@ nails , or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the nic@@ est things about digi@@ cam ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as well as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ cam ; by writing a small module to complete a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
to make the window easier you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; drawing and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the old tree , over the horizontal dividing line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be placed in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are shown you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can copy or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must right click on the album and edit the album &apos;s album properties menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be grouped by a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete collections from the collection list . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with albums sorted by date .
&quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , New Year : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . for this purpose , the average of images from their EX@@ IF information is attempted . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; open , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you then want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ pres@@ preview set@@ en@@ quot ; . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wasted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all the pictures are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can re @-@ create thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be shown below the thumb@@ nail . which information is this , you can edit the edited settings . select the albums page and customize the preview images to suit your needs . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important properties including all the tags of a photograph . the screen shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos are all about it . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this . you can choose any features that can be edited with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ You can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or the context menu of the picture with right mouse button and editing ... in the editing section editing ; image editing you can view and change your photos .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest way is to right @-@ click on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ cam ; delete , it will be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift . Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My data limit &quot; ; organizes your photos on the basis of data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with key@@ word will provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search again . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ ste@@ eg ; fold , so that you can find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and proven key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new key@@ word after you cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this will be the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and selecting the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the right mouse button and select it in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can happen in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; drag and drop them there . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail of the pictures and select the key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be shown once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can select a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this will be shown under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you click the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the choice frame that displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and even more in the future . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just have to select the appropriate entry from My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; for more information , see the Advanced search tool section . for more information , see the Advanced Search tool section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules can be added or deleted by Oper@@ ators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . furthermore , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand @-@ drawn sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the appropriate pictures .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ osed that your pictures contain Ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the bottom field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ cam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em light table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window will be opened .
&quot; from the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place it there . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use combination @-@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the sections to the same . the right adjacent image is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the picture , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zoom works as well as in other views . just use the zoom function under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; digital continu@@ ance management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digit@@ ally stores a form of digital continu@@ ance management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , protect , protect and use photos . we focus on the process for digital photographers that can use &amp; digi@@ cam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , maintaining , waiting and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ formations , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly won &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ If you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files ensures very fast search and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of the information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved disk , or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option to be stored in the metadata in &amp; edited . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data can be written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ came ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , since you should now choose each photo key@@ word , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . &quot;
&quot; all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . however , all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalog images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dreaming , associations , memories , the historic period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others looking at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand what you are moving . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions will not tell you a second time for publishing . &quot;
&quot; remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of the spatial presentation is now moving with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will be even more mature in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually rep@@ licate your travels using images with geographical indications . &amp; edited ; can also export k@@ ml files you export with Google Earth . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers may only be of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ came ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; Kro@@ ll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which reasons have a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these precau@@ tions must be handled and you may no longer be trusted as a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and the check@@ sums . in spite of this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash disks , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers warranty include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal : disk study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most frequent error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT are the most frequent error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most frequent error reason . these errors are especially read errors and displacement meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric appliances do not matter much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed Mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result leading to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gives the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not each plug @-@ in bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since over@@ voltage can be used for any cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also supply over@@ voltage sha@@ kes that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ ax cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system in order . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software are interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and and compare its security during power disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference when you consider how well your computer is protected . finally , you should always remember all the cables before going on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transfer errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are desktop @-@ safe . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says to you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is using and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % on workplace systems . not@@ ebooks are already the share of th@@ ef@@ ts 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not worry anyone else for data loss . therefore , you often secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re @-@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then , one day , a bolt would be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbour house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system the next with the exception that it is only clo@@ aked and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync just copy the difference between files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
secure important images right after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to take a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . do not use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and the area you want to zoom on to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; parti@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of the file if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ atic data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF is widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open blank format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available , and we hope that Canon and Nikon &apos;s competitors will use it at some time . &quot;
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to em@@ bed the &quot; &quot; image resource lock &quot; &quot; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers put it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edi@@ ts are , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; in the section adding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file mapping will appear for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button downloading and then download the selection of all . this downloads all the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download selected . the selected download button is di@@ mmed as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ cam until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , the new pictures will of course be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder , displayed . you can read the list of existing albums , like normal folder . for details on folder sorting , you can read my albums in the section My Albums tab . then select the finish album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can all delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you must select them first and delete them deleted afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted . if you want to delete the camera remotely , you should check it through the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for database @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created each day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transfer will open three more options that will be carried out before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % D % H % H % H : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the auto rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ cam ; use this to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based bas@@ kets at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your machine to your camera is the download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog and k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 provides many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module . &quot;
&quot; there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign of ha@@ iry coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; in order to access these settings , you need to set up the settings in the Edit menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left hand side . &quot;
select action can be set on embedded preview or image editing will start . you will therefore set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; see if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copy@@ ri@@ ghted data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ eth ; . these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ cam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ cam ; tries , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; edited ; album folder that has none of these extensions , edited by &amp; edited ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Update right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , because P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the TI@@ FF files option , you can switch the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality , since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ came , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard sampling is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels on odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminated the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned in order to look at the top lights due to the inability of your camera . the setting colors will create some unusual results , since they show the top lights in various ro@@ sem@@ ary tones . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not sati@@ re as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the yet uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it a little higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . to keep the time for the de@@ acon small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which provides many cameras and is known as a matrix @-@ coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w .
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , since you are performed during the raw conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; information such as the color information from a color space to translate into the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start . &quot;
&quot; click here to set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profiles should be matched to the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color @-@ mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon profile expansion lets you see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules support that are written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; edited . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short commands . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button Autom@@ atic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and switch on . &quot;
&quot; check whether &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the garbage dump , you can set the conversation between edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details when you delete a photo and delete an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the display of the welcome screen ; when starting , this speeds under certain circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ cam ; . &quot;
&quot; setting A Start for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ came ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; edited ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; edited ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; edited , you will find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or through the contex@@ tual menu of preview and selecting the item Display / Edit . &quot;
&quot; image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; displays a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing features of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using file Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save As . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery or button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit back or restoring , by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come in the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the Main Menu , you can print individual pictures or entire sets . whole image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Ex@@ ports Printing Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the keywords applied in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y session . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering key words in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the respective check boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the whole selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the key@@ word filter side bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - dates , key@@ word and search views . if you use one or more key@@ word filters from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created key words are available . &quot;
&quot; if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialog will appear , asking you if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is on K@@ eine key@@ word , which reduces the quantity to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the rule area . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set up an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image output is e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy , why should one use another colour gam@@ ut and therefore have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as in s@@ RGB colour space , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic compar@@ isons and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rect Autom@@ atic correction attempt automatic from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image , allowing the dark@@ est point to be black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; balance : this method adju@@ sts the colour of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the balance reaches very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
contrast enhancement : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re@@ vis@@ itation of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly restricted to work over a color space with 8 bits per color . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it through the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynamically change the setting of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result shown in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and re@@ charge it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original . if you save these settings your original image will be changed .
&quot; 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF , and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ality correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool for you to find gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar ization effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash light . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this was the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were revers@@ ed by the second illumination . this tool allows you to fine adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo . you can also experiment the different color levels of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; also in this case , the tool for brightness and satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the instrument sound correction is set for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of the slide for the application described here . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slides are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the control and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of the shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively use the output values as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used as background while something else is in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : using these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and later loaded . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input value of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified Channel : this box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most useful . for images with large areas of constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short wedge to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker for@@ ks and that the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line will appear on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p c@@ vs format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if captured in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing is a tool to improve colour channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you retain L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain its general brightness as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting you can save for later and then load . the file format used is the gi@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is preserved . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of staying a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool texture apply , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to one image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Tool@@ box frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . to retain his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce envel@@ ops it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , bent it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a bone fe@@ ather and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple and format@@ ted text into one image at any point . this can also be done in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool template , you can place a template on a picture . &quot;
the picture sten@@ cil template used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . then simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the base folder in the dialog . here , select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder refres@@ hes the thumb@@ nail of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
you can preview three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ izing .
&quot; the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points on paper are printed . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently than normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a folder icon already during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call this by using the Cor@@ rect Fol@@ der menu item . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also reinfor@@ ces the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool to get a soft character with the menu entry Cor@@ rect V@@ ist@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur@@ ring mask very strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are created near sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the Radi@@ us represents how many pixels on each side of a gun are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should sharp@@ est pictures best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the sum represents the percentage of the original and the bl@@ urred image added to the original , thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined for a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore avoided beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focused a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of an un@@ sharpen@@ ed mask . re@@ focusing mostly results in better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ king .
&quot; in practice , the circular fis@@ sion works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ itting . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ itting has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the mod@@ ulation .
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gauge &apos; sharp@@ ness &apos; . use this parameter if your bl@@ urred gauge is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before alter@@ ing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unused arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , un@@ sharp masks must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the focus correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the knob gli@@ der places the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most sophisticated tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Ri@@ der smooth@@ ing and advanced settings for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0,@@ 9 should be maintained for details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . note that the detail conservation should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction dependency . &quot;
&quot; directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD gau@@ ges , a high value produces wa@@ vy pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integration step size &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the running time . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the journey .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radio controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the distance between the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise levels may occur . place it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more powerful , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be saved to the file system and then loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was used with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharp@@ ness . use tool to sof@@ ten soft signs and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film bas@@ kets , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ cs , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a low @-@ loss compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button &quot; &quot; Stop &quot; . &quot; &quot;
below you can see like a photo with uniform noise reduction restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scanning arti@@ facts created by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw display photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method to remove . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result in the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block . &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise the sharp@@ ness effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s felt and color gra@@ ft depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ rass@@ ing @-@ Filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ strengthening at the point of the largest density filtering . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ ting reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine adjustment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ accreditation Sur@@ gery applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounded effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion of second grade . with negative values , ton @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth grade . this value acts more strongly on margins than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; verti@@ ces &apos; has the in@@ verse in@@ signia of the General parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and results in correc@@ ting first grades .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog displays the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal line of help . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the tri@@ mming tool in the Trans@@ forming tri@@ mming tool from image processing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , e.g. from front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the Pre@@ view , you can set two parameters set for film gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO control changes the amount of film bas@@ tion and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a sort of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless ambi@@ ance detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny vision especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the standard value is , although often higher values are required , adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ dation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a proprietary algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ector sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to outline yourself . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter engraving embos@@ ses your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter en@@ grav@@ ure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ y landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the finished image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses the copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is looked through by glass blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects will need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses the copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharpen@@ ed : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing camera from a car or train . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ e@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by means of random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color basin in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this makes it natural to your images a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop size allows to change the size of drops . as the size of the drop@@ let doesn &apos;t automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease size for small images .
&quot; you can choose to select a area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can navigate it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how to retrieve the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose Trans@@ forming size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
&quot; retain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any single size for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file , and will be loaded later . &quot;
&quot; bli@@ stering is very fast in what it does , but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button to stop . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
&quot; the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . to cut a photo you just have to use the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply using the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The tri@@ mming button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF charts , allowing the EX@@ IF data to reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the interaction help allow you to hide help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are an opportunity to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
golden Middle : the golden middle is a division which is divided into different natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center provides li@@ que@@ er relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition results in the gaze of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is placed at the center of the composition . this can be one line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be a static object dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break down your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the horizontal mirror options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can become invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ forming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are set in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this , it is the function Trans@@ forming tri@@ mming from the picture editing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the image is the function Automati@@ cally cut . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , be aware of the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ated area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the trans@@ form@@ ated area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ated area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right edge of the trans@@ form@@ ated area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is shifted slightly . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get immense tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming tri@@ angles from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sh@@ oring tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about trans@@ formations sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ oring tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is bl@@ urred a bit . for a single shot , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes producing twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after finishing the picture , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transforming tri@@ angles from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependency on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats that knows . this happens on the basis of file extension and comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; edited ; in the section configuration you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . in this process , redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ All support cameras can be seen down on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw data formats edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often recorded in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; however , is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . &quot;
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
&quot; if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; edited ; their description is here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft signs , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blocking , etc . . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divide . the upper area shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and put on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ osed that your pictures contain Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are stored in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folder for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color of it . the color is described below the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box App@@ ly C@@ ursor under the button Add color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written a different one ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; edit &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . if so , three numbers are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science , . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are according to the program author outdated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration into posters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; posters ; the graph re@@ comp@@ utes and in &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ art@@ viewer ; in a single and posters ; component to open
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graphs pres@@ upp@@ osed . needed in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , if you launch &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to view the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window appears : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later you can proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphical viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; file , and eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it also with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be included . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph divided on several pages , without head@@ line and with another font &quot;
&quot; the page Rec@@ re@@ charging gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of the graphic viewer if a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or specify to be asked at each start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens further options : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z layout algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statisti@@ cally multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm produces a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi@@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should indicate the graph@@ ite file as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed and ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source repository .

a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog will appear where you can choose whether to create the icon from a template , or whether you want to start anew from scratch . &quot;
&quot; restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you did not make a step backwards , this function is disabled . &quot;
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey levels . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol palette .
&quot; does not alter the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the dot on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .

&quot; add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove custom templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or show a ruler and insert a single color : or a chess board as a clear display . you can also adjust the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the Kar@@ os to Klein , Medium and Great as well as Color 1 : and Color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
&quot; scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports or a different source , such as video streams . to make this work , you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed . &quot;
&quot; when you scan the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default duc@@ ting standard values to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be completely displayed , since some settings may otherwise not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the scan button , you need to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver menu . a window appears in which you can set up the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you choose to read the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; this module records your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . likewise , the Auto@@ Play option is available for Windows platforms . &quot;
&quot; you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts , and other features into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send photos to people that are important . you can display your favorite photos online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . &quot;
&quot; after the successful login , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you press Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for two times , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button Add images should be pressed once you have all set other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button starts the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the word field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the C@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and lati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the top to see dialog appears then . to get a possible correlation to time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
when the file loads an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera can be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera operation . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have track data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching dates . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog takes the coordinates of one call to the next , you only have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . for this purpose , select the respective region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab@@ s where the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select those albums that are to be exported to HTML . you will need to select these albums only . the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will display the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
&quot; this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image one page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg . &quot;
&quot; the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail pictures allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without imp@@ acting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size rises , since no compression of the color information takes place . this is also found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this feature does not work on all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please take a look at exi@@ v2 , to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change sorting of the images or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a lower value produces very sudden , high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the generation of the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go quickly or in all peace of a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a c@@ lue appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the m@@ j@@ peg@@ s and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings on the right . &quot;
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print it directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame stays the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or to use them later otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . so use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ ride existing files . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the tool convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images in a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the picture smaller or larger . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will appear with the images you selected . add more images using the thumb@@ nail image . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the images list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button pic@@ s , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . their configuration is saved and re @-@ used each time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original dump data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced slide show , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Output option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is shown in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner around you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have added your images and videos with comments , you can work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browsing , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , you are now present in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information than you have submitted your images and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser will change . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are shown . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see also the image . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t own suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify which image to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the image viewer window ( in closer description ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search function in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again on the image . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field labelling or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched by this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview list from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview list ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created that is visible on the overview page . more information about export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are of a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically discussed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this way , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so , you can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be stored . this folder is stored and added automatically at the next time . here , you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the options described above have all three based on basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create your pictures with these . if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you have to do this work again . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can be imported into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it scans the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; in the Manu@@ ela option to close the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you may not want to send the pictures in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... choose , will import &amp; photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories to import to import file and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image below . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Plac@@ ing the information about your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual we talk about pictures , but often this includes videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS . &quot;
&quot; for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album , set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , all members of a group at one time in a group , rather than all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ cam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . more information can be found on the Ki@@ pi homepage . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : an album is just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the features with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass on a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , will &amp; photo@@ album ; so do , so if you have selected people to see and pass it on to the module . &quot;
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the image , where the image has been taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were included . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these remarks by using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , therefore , that the used names are moved upwards to find and assign persons more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each image individually , you may still want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click the before and back buttons , which are located at the top of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and to use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . note , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking on and moving the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window range . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can leave a frame completely . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and click here to hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the display image in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nail images of the currently selected images , or of all images in case you have not set filters . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the preview image . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete in the Edit menu . now the window will show you which you can see in the picture .
&quot; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the images anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can also view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , you need to copy files from folders and copy them again . &amp; photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to insert the respective CD . so if you want trouble , like the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that at the end you may want to disable all the images that your little sister may see , ta@@ int and lock the menu item all except the current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , you can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to deny the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to spend time describing them is of course , that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason has &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he , of course , shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered about the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag them with your mouse and go somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all . all of these options are available right clicking on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and back by using the p@@ ush@@ button image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . and photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can enter the picture and zoom out . you can use the mouse button to pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen is equal to one pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu point Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to tag images with features while you view them . characteristics are the characters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have added features to your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can simply add all the images you want to copy to a CD , or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in thumb@@ nail view . if you can view categories in the thumb@@ nail view , you can add features to the images by simply clicking the characters for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in order to complete the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the image from the context menu . to complete the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the object shown . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also save multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below an existing view , drag the gra@@ dient to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the f@@ itter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the top of the flash@@ card at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , pull the an@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing to the left in the fas@@ cia bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of view . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
you can save the current window view with the window arrangement ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon to render the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view . &quot;
&quot; a render mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full @-@ quality images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di , the following dialog opens : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but it makes sense to see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image cut for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or square effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and bin@@ ds &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; the second method is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive , recur@@ sive , because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the defined threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 will be calculated with extra pixels , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last adjustment for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit the object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a P@@ ov@@ ray ; import scene , select the Import menu file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full range of commands from &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross High Detailed Proj@@ ections for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing window arrangements , or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangements section you will explain how to create and save window classi@@ fications . &quot;
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below lists all views for the chosen window arrangement . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; the position of the new window . create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing windows , anchor the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating , the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything installed error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . thus you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . just click on a check@@ point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when applying the button App@@ ly or the En@@ try button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see here the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ less body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the entry button . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can open the item for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property tree ( Name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the preview button you can see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pigment shows only a matt black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet . remember , that you can check the look of the materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and bul@@ let in the preview , then click the App@@ ly button and then press the Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you can expect more settings here . in the color list you will need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should already be able to execute this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball would float above the floor , since you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the next step , use a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as in the ground , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click Ball Pig@@ ment , then select In@@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish characteristics : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter button .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even when metal is not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you can and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er you have . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing mode .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add commands pre @-@ set for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove mould symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option . add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump mapping is a way to prevent rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s or button Return .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will appear . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . pres@@ et is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , here the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider and the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short representation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short representation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short representation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is ein &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; Image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to the part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . &quot;
&quot; this is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to encourage you to send questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photos ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
the best start to participate in the show@@ photo is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of the show photo ; has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that can no longer be sc@@ anned and saved .
&quot; &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes a scan and save images . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image , or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . &quot;
you can check the status of the scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and drag ? s leads to a demo@@ lition and you return to the main window . &quot;
the button settings dialog opens the dialogue of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before Save a Pre@@ view must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option has to be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically with a generated name is to be saved in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored at option Save without asking a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help will start the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite .
&quot; &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite , is licensed under L@@ GP@@ L . note : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; below you will find a list of this abbrevi@@ ation and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , and setting up short commands ... Select . &quot;
you can configure any existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; Amar@@ ok additionally has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ run@@ ing@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly notice that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data each script must take care of itself . when a script is started Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change tells you that a new piece is being picked up . the script could now ask for further information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; finishes , or when the user stops a script , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to save space . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly identify the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is finished , you can rel@@ o@@ ad it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and yet surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very special title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to type the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , it has some options you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , please refer to the System Pre@@ ferences section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any hass@@ le over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; when the option is off , only the playlist windows will be displayed . &quot;
use the tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; save voice files in music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at the end of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep the piece visible , keep the playlist windows open / un@@ roll to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is pi@@ ped .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust the look &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using tag@@ ging of own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gra@@ yed section is activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : playlist windows , player window , and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . &quot;
&quot; re@@ play at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when you are using on @-@ screen display , you can preview the O@@ SD and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD @-@ colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ e colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text box displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the board audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers also activate more settings in this card .
the card card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders chosen &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse these sub@@ folders in ital@@ ics : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the one and their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , adding all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . &quot;
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; below calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered where the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the load card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to send the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we wrote a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD requires that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ ul@@ st@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b Develop@@ er under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file causing the crash . then you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
most of the times it is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ ation.@@ de@@ activate if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open after a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not feature as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; --@@ -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; Error when writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; See _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic play@@ lists ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the status de@@ activ@@ ates in gray and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen using ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first . &quot;
&quot; there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are best solved by the help of a specialist your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . for this , use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for looking for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right @-@ hand part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively the start -@@ sub@@ window was converted to the statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the list of the playlist and select column . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; title bar . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press the Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and drop them down there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the playlist will be saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must support loud international media types G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; you may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder is included ( for pat@@ ent@@ cial reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity@@ ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the magni@@ fier of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the registration register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with drag @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it once more . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions or requests , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will have stopped off the soft tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if there is a functioning SS@@ H environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows separated . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size changing window .
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right click sets a piece in the queue sequence in the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the Control bar &apos;s system section ? &quot;
&quot; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , no . ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous score with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can change the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then , you can change the rating of a piece just as all other attributes , by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog metadata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan , which is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . des@@ elect the option icon when playing in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was too similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then , click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . audio cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you must now install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error there is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator logs . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can with Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok set up ... Audio Output you enter the device . typically is h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , type us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check box at Sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not further looked after . of course you can take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for specific pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it by using the Play@@ list playlist . &quot;
&quot; when you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in your collection , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in order to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button Play@@ back . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here different ways to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you are installing these packages via a package management system ( such as R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a running tex@@ tual display showing the currently running track or current stream . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the drive text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the running tex@@ tual display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zer .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece posi@@ tional sli@@ ders . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or the previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will have fallen away . the information displayed there is now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performers and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be worked out and you see the content of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button , and then select one of the possibilities to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required for this purpose .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different performers . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing performer / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used . &quot;
group Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This attitude works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adapt and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter , a selection box is located , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can also select your entire collection , which makes the filter virtually shut off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ es the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queue to transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the Media Player browser section . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this artist burn / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
&quot; move files into the garbage dump ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , and then it appears among different performers . &quot;
&quot; the album will no longer be shown under different performers , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists are easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; also created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sort in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input , you can listen to music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be tricky by simply dropping files . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be useful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all items attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply clicking the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter search terms separate by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three are found ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variants as you wish , for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces containing either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; you can set the order sequence of entries by holding the C@@ tr@@ l key pressed , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add to the playlist . on the right , you will find playlist videos , play@@ lists empty and random mix@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu , you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status of random mode and retri@@ eval is easily changed by clicking the mouse double in the corresponding display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , you can disable the status bar in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . this menu allows you to reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details for setting up these follow later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , and add more random pieces while playing . &quot;
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio cro@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click the playlist , drag them to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on them and then select load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the Rec@@ ommen@@ ded ch@@ un@@ ks are added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , then enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be disabled again . &quot;
&quot; the New Player button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist edit opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; with right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed with regard to the settings played . &quot;
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . when you tick more than one playlist , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want to use . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on Con@@ figuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . after installing the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , simply click Un@@ install to delete the script . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing section . &quot;
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins are used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin you simply activate the check box next to the name .
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps to create an audio CD . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ code to MP3 you will receive a lower quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
this Quick Start will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Tools , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . now you can see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copying process . once the origin@@ als are read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium that the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search@@ path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback there , draw on community help from the forums and learn about news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and expands these functions even . so , select &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality in burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ E@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown , with which you can select folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and finishes and k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , it is asked what to do with it as if you have called File Cl@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you have created the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described about the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you rather than aid so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , but only hides the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD that will eventually burn you later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to modify size and cut black borders . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; once you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this purpose system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so rather your taste and the kind of task is critical about which of the enclosed programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void get@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void get@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script generates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folders : &quot;
$ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reading for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ ders may still be installed from Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ am@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; what encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ etter gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily usage of the read @-@ out of a &amp; CD is subsequently explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without network , with everything being collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the next step , for example , there are more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD@@ DB will start on request in the CD@@ DB regi@@ stra@@ r . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der was configured in the code settings tab in the setup catalog - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and encoding . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ acks ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting the enco@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG nowadays may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important , because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality for lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ devices exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex pieces of music and a little less for complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate app . 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR together stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ San@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file sizes , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ der program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add titles to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs that can download and insert information instead of themselves into the calcul@@ ator . it is important to note that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is also information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the program@@ mer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator is set up for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database may be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed , if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ der . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ etter .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and ob both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame to be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine , since it is considered not completely free software . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have written permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time you read a CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the read @-@ out program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab will help you to view the / etc / f@@ stab file and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card General settings . here , there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left in such a way / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information requests , you will be notified when information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change . the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server nearby . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work first . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; ej@@ ection of the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD , to disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to Version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted on demand . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of concur@@ r@@ ently enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : in a dual core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built , because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b de@@ fet@@ ched data . therefore you will learn the data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will draw attention to the differences . &quot;
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , search in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers for the Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments for each piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; just select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the tap@@ ered CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the data . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; click on the next line in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD . &quot;
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the selection process by clicking the button Sel@@ ection , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the Ri@@ der orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error when trying to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece of reading .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . so read out and encoding simultaneously . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able appears is the number of concur@@ rent processes for reading and encoding . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of different cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to continue from this empty screen ( especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD ; located in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
who reads this probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke Bar by &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some properties that others &amp; UNIX don &apos;t have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in case of multiple pieces they are added to a collection and then played in succession . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and so alter the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu , then interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics of lyrics and again some other . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically identified , which a song is used so that you don &apos;t have to manually adjust it . so if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you will automatically have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a type of event , select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the wish in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the Main Menu Collection , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button Pre@@ vious piece , the item Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map provides general @-@ MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano events in the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when originally playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
&quot; in this section , you will see how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the term &quot; &quot; drum @-@ patch &quot; &quot; is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; key@@ boards are mainly used to form sounds on the percussion channel . for example , look at the supplied key maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; this is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name Name for this channel will be used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful in order to always use the percussion cap on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio is given in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of Kla@@ vi@@ aturen ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano atures you can see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button no longer shines green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select settings under the channel view : settings &quot;
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed and etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I open a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or go ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I need to play a file just in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch automatic adding to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ M. and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so you set the setting Autom@@ atic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , that , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . I &apos;m studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t have any money for it . I would like to stress that I only need to write more , because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or just a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition , it can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the issue to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu Book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation during starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / DATA@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / apps / KM@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the start does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / m ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / m ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / s ; &amp; lt ; / m ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f .
&quot; there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , just like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to restore the &amp; KM@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is in a console application to run and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that always a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog can be found in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video for@@ lin@@ ux expansion needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally , KM@@ player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the origin of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource . &quot;
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after the device is plu@@ gged into . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be mounted on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU needs to be checked for its performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ st k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer needs automatically the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the Editor of Po@@ sters . &quot;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a la@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; while here is only a good review to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book on it . to be able to master properly , good books should be used , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ lib@@ class , the body starts with the \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the Quick entry wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . some may also be made to the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article &#93; , Book &#91; Report &#93; , Book &#91; Report &#93; , Book &#91; Report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ r &#93; , Films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
code encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best it should be UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Let@@ ter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t want to worry about it . it is only a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the emphasis on the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le , a simple problem search is possible . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le , automatically a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( this is the highest and sub@@ stan@@ tive element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the search search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI @-@ file &#91; source e V ice I n@@ dependent file &#93; &#93; was created , le@@ aps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is , in addition to PDF , the edi@@ table output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are kno@@ cked with the editor and as soon as one element is cli@@ cked in the DVI file ; the pre@@ diction is the exact opposite of it . as soon as one cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the corresponding area in the DVI ; viewer jumped . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set for project settings .
quick building : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is backed by the &quot; &quot; back &quot; &quot; and there is no call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields should be found . the selection fields have been developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick creation of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Com@@ missions for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Other is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , notes , or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a term for a paragraph , a picture or a different element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( sel@@ ectable selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © es is used for the definition of the letters . the text can be set for the main text , the joint notes , etc . the following letters are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ \ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font length . if the font is not set at the beginning , this may also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the construction or the push of a button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storing it automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using quick @-@ build , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the recording should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report is created with the font 12 and only a few drops should have another font . &quot;
the changes are transmitted only within the environment ( by \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many ways to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ titles , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and play . &quot;
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI file to other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats by means of the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
pre@@ text search allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern can be set up under Settings box ... Building up tools . &quot;
&quot; in order to perform the pre@@ fix search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and afterwards cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer takes place then . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and spec@@ kled to the corresponding line . to this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as a text editor ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; should errors occur when using the quick @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file tells the source code of the source code . in the editor , the icons Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and Next @-@ La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . to view the incorrect line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; navig@@ ating to the er@@ ron@@ eous line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template you use for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re @-@ written or the wizard will be used for quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file open or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ \ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the resulting instructions of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn his options , the manual must be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with reading the chapter working with the Editor of Po@@ sters . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands available in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &quot; &quot; &amp; tex &quot; &quot; word . this means that in this way , by clicking on \ \ par , \ \ par \ \ big@@ / it is simply \ \ par rated . &quot;
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to emphasize it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jumping brands . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items , jump marks or the corresponding key feature are able to jump to the next or last jump brand . this is also highlighted by this jump brand , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a sign . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; ads ; already offers excellent options , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; Source text added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; used to include many environments and groups and therefore supported &amp; Ki@@ le ; the following commands for text selection are included : &quot;
&quot; includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , this does not mean a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an expanded meaning , since this command also contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a dotted line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit Select Par@@ agra@@ ph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to surround the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; when the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by { ... } . in the Edit Te@@ X group , a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or after the braces of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted braces par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview can be lost quickly . this command bu@@ ys the last formed group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a guide . for the purpose @-@ to @-@ use implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple quotes is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
there can also be any specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ rus or French ) and therefore German or French trademarks used . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; shift ; enter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , close and box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to save this . even though this tab is not the associated row , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ s . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; ads ; already offers a good source code , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are installed . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings tab . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and possibly gr@@ ind@@ ed by the result list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; even jumping brands can be put into place , so that a simply jump to these positions is possible by means of the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ sten jump brand and the desired parameters can then be captured . &quot;
&quot; under Settings tab , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ cep@@ tual settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different W@@ ing lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for performing environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call for full @-@ time mode will result in a large @-@ scale listing with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the integrity of environments . &quot;
&quot; when invo@@ king the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mode over the menu to complete the menu , or the key key Alt + Shift key , the command to surround the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is complete , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that this is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be executed . &quot;
&quot; under Settings tab , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ cep@@ tual settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the drop @-@ down list of the full screen for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of sections that can be replaced immediately by a lower string . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the code L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the menu to complete the change or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Space Bar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . however , it has been found that many users are written more than once in a document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the box settings box ... Ki@@ le can be completely destroyed . here , the swelling value can also be specified for the ad placement . &quot;
&quot; the integrity files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ ste / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( trun@@ cation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to over@@ look the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be followed and taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for the changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the Cre@@ ate , Cre@@ ate , and Gener@@ ate view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other transformation can be used the key@@ word Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be converted to a PS file by Alt ; 4 using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and viewed via Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Building Command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project will be asked about the project &quot; &quot; New Project &quot; . &quot; the following information will be asked for the project : &quot;
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed over scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first , it must be said that the application environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete operating instruction for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le , then only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , making &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &quot; &quot; Ki@@ le &quot; &quot; project and offer many hours for the development of tools that we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for emails . with the command line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is from &amp; sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures , the same signature is read from &amp; sig for the whole day . for each day use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; and add your signature in the lower section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the Save icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like , then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove from the tool@@ bar . &quot;

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit we give it a graphical interface ! no longer on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and done !
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the war@@ med work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical user interface . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply let the current job folder be selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file be simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Review selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , already selected , then leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have , with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , do not have to do anything . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start using the plu@@ gins menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( your identity ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something happens . see for more information . &quot;
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up to the project and / etc ;
&quot; on the page Event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . you differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can either choose the note entry from the Editor context menu or add the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by note text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the set nick@@ name of the team member , should be given the appropriate range or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up via attitudes Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are dealt with each other .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , concerning tags , including car completion , can be changed . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; update the start and finish day automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replace of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for recognition of different types of files .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise as opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , regularly backup backup copies , so that a power failure or crash may restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for un@@ saved documents , backup regularly , according to the set time , is created . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview , and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the windows settings to the standard next to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through by alter@@ ing M@@ DI modes and sc@@ aling / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ reset layout command line parameter .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks from non @-@ requ@@ esting requests .
the place to change the behavior of V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document can be set in detail .
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Stru@@ cture Tree Con@@ figuration Area , the visibility of node in the tree , the update frequency of the tree in the editing and how deep can be automatically opened when changing the structure tree . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are such , in which no item was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be administered . plu@@ gins are the third @-@ party applications that can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; download component in &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action triggers the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or stop the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible , in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instructions and go to the next , as if there were the current ones . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . adapt to your needs and how you can help to become better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder includes two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic lad@@ ders of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which could insert text and statements more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag displays the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without any risk of a write error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bears the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for class type . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
&quot; returns the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog , and attribute tree to the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag groups the elements of a list together . it can happen only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only appear once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tag that has to be defined . this element is a single element type .
there is a list of elements ending a day . this element is a single element type .
all tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; blan@@ ks do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files is the Tools Di@@ alogue above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and Check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently the check is only done when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; void &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
name = DT@@ D ; / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action to create the same dialog :
&quot; this action has been assigned to the keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the Custom Button , you can assign a short@@ cut to the keyboard ; with K@@ eine the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that modify the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be received by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be indicated what to do with the text written in the standard output , by setting the value in the input field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , activate &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that entering the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics For further programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it still needs to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still which ones , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog via Settings tool bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the item to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might be able to examine in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , repository if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . language . then you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
&quot; blan@@ ks do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to design context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; you are not alone . it is possible to share the wasted resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is a menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where everyone else &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . users can download them . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can search for one . in the dialog New Resource , you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and start up@@ loading with clicking OK . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , we examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
&quot; Doc@@ type : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars about actions , everything that is identified as globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can use them personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ it the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the flash@@ ings with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other , or all of the card@@ boards , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane will result in a further context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags located under the mouse cur@@ sor , or open the file if the string is a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the editors of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate , open and ro@@ am in the information . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button , more functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system based on the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &apos; Docum@@ entation site , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
&quot; the tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . send the tool@@ bar as compressed t@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an email you can backup them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure this is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure and HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &quot;
&quot; automation makes it possible for web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , converts special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
&quot; switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &quot; &quot; Shift &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
off and switch off the problem re@@ porter at the lower edge of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries predic@@ tions or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ing after the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
attitudes like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be stored by means of actions , etc . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows you to upload tool bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without rene@@ wing all &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
this entry is always present in the tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the inser@@ tion by means of the tool@@ bar is refused if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed among the above mentioned menu points . clicking on it activ@@ ates it . clicking on a plu@@ gins activate it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available lift schem@@ ata depends on the posters ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over may sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated . &quot;
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window is switched on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
&quot; judge the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and modify the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help in line with the cur@@ sor &apos;s environment , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , as , for example , after filling the project name the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Features . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and no spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ u.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make a selection of good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profile or change using the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) used for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event actions are performed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at this moment . &quot;
to open another project select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ cho@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries need to be opened and opened with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removing . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk does not save the password .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should be able to choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily , but each with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. through simple exchange of view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with whom one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . best viewed using the tool@@ bar menu . use and Ad@@ dition are different . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can either be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars or tool@@ bars can be executed , where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will additionally remove the entries action and displayed action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bars ... and setting actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in templates using global templates .
&quot; documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special documents are grouped into corresponding sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As a template Save As a template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this purpose , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project file , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or associate with them . additionally , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template index . if a root folder is set in this way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be common header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to complete a complete presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers through copying contents templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders , copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source editor when required .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green icon shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke is activated from one window to another and the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Set@@ anta Set@@ ting .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow . &quot;
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor . this can change the following :
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the contents , such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text processing , due to moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor acts as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typing and deleted by button or Rem@@ ove button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same manner via the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding Anker day . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the sp@@ read@@ sheet assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistent are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; to compile with &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to successfully compile , do not need &amp; bark ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compati@@ bil@@ ity@@ mode you can set orph@@ aned bracket points in a specified file and line number and be activated later .
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g calcul@@ ates the full path from a file name without path specification . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style template file names with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a given mod@@ us@@ name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNA@@ P@@ line containing the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a desired stopping point has to be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in a line and changes in white notes . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function converted and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 , when merging folders : &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white notes and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white notes , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; open dialogue allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merging folders will be started . if a file is selected , for B and C , a folder is used for B and C , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing from &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are the characters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merging ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white notes are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare single cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merging or manually editing , there is no more line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue is displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps yet again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merging conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the numbers or ignor@@ ing Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white notes . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side , side , bottom , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merging columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window was declared ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the cli@@ p@@ board to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and eliminates the manual copying . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the operating system &apos;s underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use drag and line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps track of source files . therefore , you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the last used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays type@@ faces with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically create an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying to cli@@ p@@ board is eliminated . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart track &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save just a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . comments in comments are treated like changes in white notes . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective with complex and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in Autom@@ atic Continu@@ ing Mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merging menu . &quot;
&quot; these options are handled in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge operation . for details , see documentation for directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to stop &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there will be globally controlled via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; a short note will appear on the selection fields for the encoding , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the encoding of output commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress her@@ edi@@ ts of changes in white characters in text or over@@ views columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . current file merging in the merge menu also works when you compare only two files . a simple click launches the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your needs . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ line to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression of the text found on each string and in this context all characters in a row relate to the found text in the first clamp . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
&quot; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions . you &apos;re very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l few details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) you need only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and merging , while the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may not acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers have to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge full folders in recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate merging and show the simulated changes without actually performing them
... &quot; perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you have to select the respective menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; when you read the folder , you will be notified of a small news window of the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist the merging cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified , and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file is executed after the other one . you status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge operation was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should check a last check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C will be used as a target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , B will be chosen as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ short@@ cut ) . in order to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid interaction actions due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that points to the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
then select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merging window opens ( see the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select / resume file merging or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the item or solve the problem in another way before you merge with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you can see &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .@@ Fol@@ ders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous poin@@ ter marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to folders : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and searched recur@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that later both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only merging entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again when you launch the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modi@@ fiers . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . first of all , K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts always the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; then dis@@ ables &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist in the unified format . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part is executed , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name &quot; &quot; K@@ Di@@ ff &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; K@@ Diff@@ 2 &quot; &quot; already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white notes is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this is is the attribute this is is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor .
after removing text is sudden ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
you can find information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ r@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists . &quot;
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ oval ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) paste the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will not be missing after merging . ( the behavior will be switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the A , B and C label below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ set@@ ters in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white notes . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working space , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working surface and on other working spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager ... and exit . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , then appear the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; Show the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is indicated along with name , the names will be marked with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the program window proportions . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as from P@@ ager applications appears in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual working areas are horizontal and vertical in a vertical line , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its contents and move . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... let the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you need to login as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : they include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for using &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is called the selection box below . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you may &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cur@@ sor . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this is also possible with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the drop @-@ down box . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down box . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
stopping or stopping the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; auto @-@ upload your set @-@ up short commands to store files , open a new window , printing , new@@ lines ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Com@@ peti@@ tors &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier area , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;

&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is waiting for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and cause pain to each mouse click . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is waiting for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who are suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse clicks causes pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and , as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . this way you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button . the intelligent delay requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this dwell time must be c@@ logged after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ent Move is enabled , the turn@@ table shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , one click with right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this moves in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the rider General . there is a slider bar , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will be selected &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at the moment . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last moving of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be disabled at first . if you are then used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse button . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using intelligent shifting in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool can stop the operation any more by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . however , parking your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want a keyboard input . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use smart delay if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this way , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case in most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , causing pain to be pressed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; mouth ; is a program , with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sets from a list with the conversation history , which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text passages book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages , without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in word completion . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input box for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a flow memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , set correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the running memory . you can select phrases that should be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , page word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the voice @-@ over@@ s , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the code encoding when the text is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the language generator unchanged as standard input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text passages book or in the tool@@ bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of immediate words , the selected text passage is spoken directly and inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially recorded only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pas@@ sage@@ way should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pas@@ time book is not saved . select Pre @-@ saving , will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passages book should be saved . &quot;
the page Wor@@ ter@@ send@@ ling contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box you can select the currently used dictionary on word completion .
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or using the arrow keys and the &quot; &quot; Alt &quot; &quot; key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the cache will be selected . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the cache will be selected . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the running memory . &quot;
&quot; when this menu item is checked , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default above the editing window directly below the menu bar . by clicking on the left @-@ hand side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; when this menu item is checked , a sli@@ dable bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is ordered by default above the editing window directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the left @-@ hand side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice output voice output . ( see settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to carry on without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ e.@@ The voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use t@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service page , which appears in the E@@ k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mouth ; is an application with which people unable to speak text can be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences are stored , which the user can rel@@ inqu@@ ish over and over again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; don &apos;t have a voice synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; read texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor and posters ; , even if folders ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech output is done through the speech speech dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ b@@ ail@@ out program .
&quot; Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;

an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts of it .
&quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de files . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and configure program speech dis@@ pat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card General is displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the flash@@ card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot;
all already established actors appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker available .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the actors in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to enable the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text assignments .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the speech dispens@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to enable the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can make text orders and read the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it is running &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the control bar while reading , it disappears once the reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start , break , pause , and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the g@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text you want to read and select the Text main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML pages and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read and select the Text main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
this also works when &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications such as eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you about events defined by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , for example , that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item noti@@ fications appears in the menu Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited before it is sent to the speech speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the mode of operation of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the display of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of applications that use text assignments . text assignments are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
&quot; string plac@@ er replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string inser@@ tions filters , which allow the setting of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert and XML ; from one format to another format . in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with speech selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice on the card speaker for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . editing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further information will be displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for setting of string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the order shown above .
click here to move the word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . if you load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker is talking about one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages , if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key while clicking . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied only if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separately from comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited both sides by dividing lines ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package c@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; add a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties which the program gives , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the properties of speakers set on the card card speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can enter it by clicking the button to get help at entry . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; with the program@@ mer to give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program t@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands to
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . first start in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with every speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a single console .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , draw the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages at rate . also look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the speech &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and expand for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ ward ports , or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use your speech synthes@@ izer , check first if speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . for this purpose , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts used by the speech dis@@ pat@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program is to be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech dis@@ pat@@ chers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text will be broken down into individual sentences . the user can return sentences or paragra@@ phs , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . thus , an application can request a female English speaker . if you want to know a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , this will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add to Add to Add a Spe@@ aker to Add a Spe@@ aker to the list or click Edit , the card card Player Setup will be shown . as an example , the configuration of the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules you will find under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that is handed over to the festival . if you are aware that Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; this slider lets you adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controllers and display this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click on App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is selected at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol dict@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the read . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons in this row , you can proceed or go back in the order placed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
with one click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of kt@@ ts ; see in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts will be compiled ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . &quot;
&quot; set the talk speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equ@@ als half and 200@@ Shipping ; % about the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take the new settings for the running &amp; running system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this map you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . once the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that appeals to messages . if you can read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text message is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the expenses of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the flash@@ card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled al@@ erts . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is checked , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read out . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the board of the card speaker as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose you can set the warning messages as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button store to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries apart from all Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . besides brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 1 ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this allows you to advance or stop orders faster with the read , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set of by@@ laws . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of by@@ laws is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add another set of by@@ laws , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the language selection by trying out . turn on the selection of speakers and select text to read . check the selection of the speakers , change some properties and check how the speaker selection changes . of course , you need to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read more about it , please do not hesitate to contact us . if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
&quot; you can order or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is set up automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional elements and insert a tab mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ J ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c included . &quot;
&quot; on the board selection menu , you can over@@ write the voice settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking qualities are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber here . if this property does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place several markings here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is preferred if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speakers , which is best to delete the following , click on the standard Spe@@ aker button and then use on Spe@@ akers , which is most likely to follow the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; it immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not receive any trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is probably an un@@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved by this , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try upgrading or un@@ installing G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I simultaneously play music with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur in AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . consult the AL@@ SA project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / or the new voice added . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; at the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Inter@@ active also offer an adjustment for speed on the card card for microphone setup . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set up the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own drawing filter filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer in the way forward or back . on the board of orders it is displayed , the order consists only of one sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for the set of rules instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ ul@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the talk speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs .
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the policies of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option to turn off the creation shows the configure parameter that causes the transition of creation .
&quot; as default is installed &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example &quot;

CD : echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with Festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &quot; &quot; Linux &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . therefore , find festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
&quot; with this method , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the Fol@@ der Festival / lib / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS English Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 it is not necessary to re@@ compile error correc@@ tions , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual work the german de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS English Festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to give the language via festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . buy and first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download festival Czech from
&quot; un@@ pack the program with tar in a suitable folder , and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed with this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &quot; &quot; Linux &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . therefore , search Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ tier speech synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Page and un@@ zip it to the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ s T@@ TS language synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ s programs are not placed in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the board of cards . enter a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor voice speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf and create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ . the device at all and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and running Linux . if network devices are later added , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network settings module is loaded when the option Network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this is attempted to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting of non @-@ re @-@ questions , the definition can be made permanently . when the network settings are started , then this selection will be pres@@ et automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , change is not possible . in system administration mode , you can enter system administration mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the Reiter Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network interfaces are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Network Interface :
the set of network interfaces shown can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the click of the button ... in the Dialog box set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button &quot; &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; &quot; to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; when selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . &quot;
&quot; with the choice manual , you can set the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . on @-@ off a disabled network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn off an enabled network device , by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution part of the name resolution enables easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be ranked by selecting an entry and ascending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ ts or Her@@ among in the priority list . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution you can add a DNS server . it will add New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... You will see the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known hosts describes the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of well @-@ known hosts contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias names , press the button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
&quot; select an entry of a name @-@ known computer from the list , and select Edit ... Edit The Dialog box will be shown . &quot;
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings made in the Network settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) enough when &amp; k@@ de and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , you can use a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given ; in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf and changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is communicated to a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focusing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is attributable . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact person to use a valid IP address or , if available , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically in case of DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time plans of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; sp@@ it back the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects and k@@ dat ; do not recognize the pr@@ elu@@ de on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the strap , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger . &quot;
before a band can be used by &amp; dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat .
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before you use it . flo@@ ppy drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
after entering the band name and capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape continue . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the View menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed in backup files , only the files located in the same fil@@ esystem are stored as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the other files . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted , and dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command l@@ ends load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; dat ; blocking the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the band will automatically be thrown out ; do not use this option for flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .

&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to access information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system uses the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features with which protocol files can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you do not display it , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not start with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log file , for normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter out a selected criterion or string . in addition , the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will show the entry to the selected filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with an eye @-@ catching color as protocol lines of level indication . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can see the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window contex@@ tual menu to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more information about the source sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for monitoring program start @-@ ups when running the system in the Linux world . and that is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further down here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start at the start of the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be located on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this then you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you get confused at the in@@ it@@ tab . &quot;
&quot; but how does all the correct scripts start now ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
just like starting and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . in order to merely copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target range of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator key to enable the different work@@ spaces ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the product number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are restored to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n and now the machine is starting to start again . what can I do ?
&quot; on the LI@@ LO prompt , enter lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions is not standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly arranged . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you can use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have selected space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can make individual adjustments . &quot;
the card card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
&quot; this card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognis@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with space restriction by means of the field fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the groups of cards are informed about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
