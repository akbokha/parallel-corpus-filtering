<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"tree-maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, you can easily detect large files, even then easily if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap account is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the shading depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is available at all, only if there is enough room for displaying or whether the area is used by subordinate rectangles. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"with representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be maintained that the surface area is proportional to the size of the entry. it is not always respected in the Treemap in & FSView. it is used frames to show the nesting of entries, and this frame needs space that is then lost to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive divisions."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer.</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 is a free, distributive software collection for digital cameras that support an ever-increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communicating with the machine. since photos are generally large files and are slow to transfer over the serial port, this connection is now deprecated. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using gPhoto2."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably by digicam. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may see thumbnails, or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things about digicam; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as well as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicam; by writing a small module to complete a function as the changes in & digicame; even perform."</seg>

<seg id="239">"TIFF is widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types."</seg>
<seg id="240">"DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open blank format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available, and we hope that Canon and Nikon's competitors will use it at some time."</seg>
<seg id="241">"this may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to embed the" "image resource lock" "technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers put it in front of an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put it all together."</seg>

<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels are generally not satire as quickly as green and red. & digicam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, automatic comparisons and contrast extend from the menu Correct Automatic correction attempt automatic from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire image, allowing the darkest point to be black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"balance: this method adjusts the colour of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the balance reaches very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a revisitation of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly restricted to work over a color space with 8 bits per color. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it through the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically change the setting of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result shown in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and recharge it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save these settings your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for tonality correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool for you to find gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digicam; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar ization effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. this was the effect that the brighter areas were reversed by the second illumination. this tool allows you to fine adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original picture is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo. you can also experiment the different color levels of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"also in this case, the tool for brightness and saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mould gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the instrument sound correction is set for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of the slide for the application described here."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slides are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the control and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the medium for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gamma values."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually it sharpens no bit it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customizing.</seg>
<seg id="483">"the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points on paper are printed. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently than normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a folder icon already during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can call this by using the Correct Folder menu item."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool to get a soft character with the menu entry Correct Visters and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the blurring mask very strong, noise and the impression of grates are created near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the Radius represents how many pixels on each side of a gun are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpest pictures best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the sum represents the percentage of the original and the blurred image added to the original, thus the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimal difference can be defined for a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore avoided beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocused a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of an unsharpened mask. refocusing mostly results in better results than unsharp masking.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular fission works much better than the Gauß'sche Fitting. the Gauß'sche Fitting has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the modulation.</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge 'sharpness'. use this parameter if your blurred gauge is' sch '. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before altering the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unused artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, unsharp masks must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the focus correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob glider places the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most sophisticated tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings for this purpose."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the picture. a value of 0,9 should be maintained for details so that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. note that the detail conservation should always be subordinated to the direction dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed. if you have a film granulator or CCD gauges, a high value produces wavy pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integration step size [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the running time."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the journey.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radio controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the distance between the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise levels may occur. place it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG facts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more powerful, but also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be saved to the file system and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpness. use tool to soften soft signs and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film baskets, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Francs, and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a low-loss compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button" "Stop". ""</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see like a photo with uniform noise reduction restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures have been reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scanning artifacts created by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp."</seg>

<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: an average of neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block."</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">"the digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise the sharpness effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's felt and color graft depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>

<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth grade. this value acts more strongly on margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'vertices' has the inverse insignia of the General parameter."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and results in correcting first grades.</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog displays the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the ton- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be apparent."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal line of help. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the Transforming trimming tool from image processing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motives, e.g. from front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture."</seg>
<seg id="592">"below the Preview, you can set two parameters set for film gradation and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO control changes the amount of film bastion and the dominance of the colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs, as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a sort of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film gradation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless ambiance detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy vision especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the standard value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film gradation effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a proprietary algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"the upper selector selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to outline yourself. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; filter engraving embosses your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"the filter engravure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mony landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the finished image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>

<seg id="612">"wave blocks 2: similar to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks."</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects will need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpened: blurs the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurs the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurs the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blurring: blurs the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing camera from a car or train."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softening blur: blurs the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelesharpness: blurs the image by means of random shift of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basin in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new."</seg>
<seg id="623">"some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural to your images a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drops. as the size of the droplet doesn't automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can choose to select a area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can navigate it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how to retrieve the missing information here or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose Transforming size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"retain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any single size for photo magnification can be saved as text file, and will be loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"blistering is very fast in what it does, but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button to stop."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">"the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture. to cut a photo you just have to use the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The trimming button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in high-format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button the area to cut to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF charts, allowing the EXIF data to reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the interaction help allow you to hide help, so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Middle: the golden middle is a division which is divided into different natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liqueer relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition results in the gaze of the spectator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is placed at the center of the composition. this can be one line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break down your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button, you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can become invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose Transforming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are set in degrees. with the Preferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is shown on the right of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this, it is the function Transforming trimming from the picture editing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the function Automatically cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. however, be aware of the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:"</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>

<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right edge of the transformated area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image is shifted slightly. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adapted the perspective, you get immense triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming triangles from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the shoring tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformations scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area."</seg>
<seg id="680">"for your help, a vertical and horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the scoring tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shot, this effect is mostly negligible, but two notes producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename stays the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"the Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your images frequently or to use them later otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. so use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to override existing files. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images in a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the picture smaller or larger. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">"print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adapted accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent.</seg>

<seg id="881">"after selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added the mail."</seg>
<seg id="882">"the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted from lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format."</seg>
<seg id="883">"if you select JPEG under image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original dump data will be added to the images to be sent."</seg>

<seg id="921">"finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are of a party."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically discussed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this way, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images that have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. so, you can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image bigger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="926">"the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>

<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>

<seg id="940">".kim files are normal zip files. since most images are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the Export File option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, you may not want to send the pictures in full size since the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image below."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it must be simple to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or square effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing, to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the defined threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 will be calculated with extra pixels, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivisions."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add titles to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoder. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Koetter.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here the term" "drum-patch" "is meant to represent a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc.) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"keyboards are mainly used to form sounds on the percussion channel. for example, look at the supplied key maps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following patterns:"</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you might be able to examine in & quantaplus, repository if someone has already done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>

<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">"blanks do not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which serves to design context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global usage. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus, community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"you are not alone. it is possible to share the wasted resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is a menu entry like DTD DTD package (DTEP) send with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where everyone else & quantaplus. users can download them. to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can search for one. in the dialog New Resource, you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can be empty) and start uploading with clicking OK."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD-Package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, we examine & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination Name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folders.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"Doctype: the string that is in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd"</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emit the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2219">"the synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Setanta Setting....

<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function converted and kdiff3; almost in a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">"& cdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & cdiff3, when merging folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& cdiff3; shows the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white notes and tabs are shown visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white notes, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialogue allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging folders will be started. if a file is selected, for B and C, a folder is used for B and C, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"when merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & cdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you don't have to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing from & cdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three spring windows are the characters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, one can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white notes are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare single cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>

<seg id="2319">"to copy the clipboard to the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminates the manual copying."</seg>

<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the encoding of output commands."</seg>

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newline to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression of the text found on each string and in this context all characters in a row relate to the found text in the first clamp. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions. you're very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However perl few details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) you need only (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>

<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual."</seg>

<seg id="2621">"in Filters, text is edited before it is sent to the speech speech dispenser. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace wrong words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to bypass certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"to understand the mode of operation of filters, it is important to know how the program" speech-Dispatcher "works with a text."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification of & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom. editing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders that are listed in backup files, only the files located in the same filesystem are stored as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the other files."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to access information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system uses the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, tries to provide some advanced features with which protocol files can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; features to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you do not display it, you have & ksystemlog; very likely not start with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log file, for normal users usually do not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter out a selected criterion or string. in addition, the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will show the entry to the selected filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with an eye-catching color as protocol lines of level indication. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can see the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window contextual menu to display all new added protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more information about the source sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for monitoring program start-ups when running the system in the Linux world. and that is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further down here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start at the start of the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be located on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this then you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you get confused at the inittab."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the correct scripts start now? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">Just like starting and stopping init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that only lets httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. in order to merely copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target range of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorter numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to enable the different workspaces (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the product number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are restored to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine is starting to start again. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"on the LILO prompt, enter linux single and press the input button to start the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are launched in these distributions, the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions is not standard. authors of & ksysv, are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and if they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly arranged."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save it. either you can use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have selected space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created where you can make individual adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized (recognisable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system)."</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with space restriction by means of the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the groups of cards are informed about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analog."</seg>
