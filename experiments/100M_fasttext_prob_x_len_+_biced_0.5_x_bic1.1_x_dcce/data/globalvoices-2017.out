&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free on Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I was living in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only increased . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived in , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very sch@@ wär@@ eric love letter about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in multi@@ tudes . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the nominated candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , the people from all over the world record , a deep faith man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also tru@@ mp world@@ view did not correspond to that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits into the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Dan@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp was preparing his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; sorting out people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , have voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note . Ü ) : &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in allu@@ ding to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like the big Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election Donald Tru@@ mp , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had an exchange of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; scre@@ amed the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is Tru@@ mp Land now , said the message . &quot;
&quot; all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and it breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music with garbage

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ ker violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI says : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re@@ processed material and that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about 1 billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind to their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to run one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u recalls , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and safegu@@ ards resources , was founded by F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stopping illeg@@ ally fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it concerns illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstruc@@ ted by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , actions are happening today in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , for example , news about suspi@@ cious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform has been created to rec@@ laim USD 20 million in lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of fantasi@@ es , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You must not run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole attempts to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
the closed front has been working so far .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships . &quot;
&quot; it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has tra@@ cked and found fled ships . &quot;
&quot; due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly being developed helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information to each other . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Ocean Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of any trac@@ e@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project which allows a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that used to be f@@ ished without license earlier and hardly expected to face consequences now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ ri@@ u says . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to join the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state in Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , the proof that such a special , collaborative working method for protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot; &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the presidential resolution of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by gathering in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ des Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , located in the central north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the ten@@ ure of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the opportunity to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to participate in mass demonstrations against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time testify to the overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ?

&quot; on Twitter , images portra@@ ying confron@@ tations as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statements in front of the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral back safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the turn that will scale the level of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your ten@@ ure !
on the road !
&quot; others values these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , under@@ took little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be concerned with letting critical voices con@@ verse : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always take more and more intensity and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or go shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept secret of family secrets .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed it was okay . &quot;
I felt like a secret magic .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

archive recording .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP partners . &quot;
just that they will not guide you one day and I have to save you then .

therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; then the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me waiting at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I stepped in and saw a Lie@@ ge that people were tortured .
she looked like a bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just tied up there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , out@@ cast him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to the eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - they were all tied at their hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people were cau@@ ti@@ ously sitting on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you kill me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were cast into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers . &quot;
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor of the survivors , the civilian ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen stuff .
&quot; at that time , at the age of age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; as they called it was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military bad@@ ges that are taken away from an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could do with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; You who l@@ ent cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded fur@@ y , struck me and cried out , &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied that no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; when you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her mother who had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act that one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they picked up machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the det@@ ain@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; they were gr@@ ind@@ ed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the idea of viewing my father was created during a conversation , when he was placed under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ wardly upset and asked myself , why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I replaced the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally testified against my own father .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases prison terms between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ st@@ terrorism &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and taken to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :

a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO too &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where one can pro@@ long its driving license . &quot;
the photo was distributed in the social media .
revision of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnessed a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20 .
&quot; the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n &apos;s published daily newspaper wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the especially un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo for the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a true translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread transmission of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and to convey active language skills in order to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations in the company . then , the Japanese co @-@ worker , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the phrases and enig@@ matic phrases , created by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large corporations or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more thorough translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the Kyoto City will hopefully make use of a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and on TV
&quot; the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online broad@@ caster . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online channels also survived recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was linked and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet sites are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if an Internet site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds to errors or refuses to request the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls will be slaves to receive a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ s who became victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . usage with kind permission from structural .
&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a review of structural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride talking about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money leaves its under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more wealthy family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke to Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , especially young girls , who had been affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ adi@@ s guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that has her daughter in the faith that she can complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of it &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even never know about them .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which is taking place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly after she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military master Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a police officer at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck with a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ ICEF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice deeply rooted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows registered than children , &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to violate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation into the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be a landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ s are not only exploited as labor , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register for bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to divide the time so that she was still time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but this time too was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never star@@ ved , but didn &apos;t eat unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house than food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ isers of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who listened as he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . thus they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home again to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , it was perfectly clear that she paid for everything she had received from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ bbing and har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ p@@ ples are exposed to when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting starting Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the heart@@ land who wants to work . &quot;
then the author of the ad switched on again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies from former cri@@ adi@@ s , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to their &quot; wives &quot; ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores were forced into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ qualities in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill to register Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; the regulations governing the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months by adop@@ ting the law , users must register on the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs across the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not give a indication of how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , commented Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that , just as they forci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to supervis@@ e the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative of the Parliament and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that fight through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ard in the wild is minimal and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera @-@ all , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
&quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , reported the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to re@@ construct the lives of those affected by the triple catastrophe in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate neighbourhood were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal cities off the map . &quot;
&quot; even so , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , and alone 160@@ ,000 people had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Special Report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in @-@ the @-@ war , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , still , six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated from accommodation quarters ( in the south , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , one still endeav@@ oured to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ees were evacu@@ ated to homes after the disaster . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have been affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear &quot; restricted zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level , as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only contain 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants have felt it more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey reported that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident population , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
as it is for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture also witnessed the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were converted into permanent re@@ plac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 stand , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people are older than 50 years old . they are known to be capable of re@@ pairing Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games scheduled to take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if you meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one connects more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , let &apos;s take a look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa refers to the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was hospit@@ alized this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia had beaten him against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the police officer &apos;s face is to be seen , attacking a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás had announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation into the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police raid shel@@ ters
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday it was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than over the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
&quot; this must also be recognised , if you are strictly against any form of damage . &quot;
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered by head@@ lines entitled &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the Ent@@ indu@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years since the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry was still in the region and the factory lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uted daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rose every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane mill would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the volume produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motivation for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and were hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose over a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approx . 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about closing the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those questioned are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts which would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most sophisticated industrial area of Cuba and the most important job generator has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the communities in which they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for closing sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to interfere , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without any future prospects , many young people once left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ two harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , in order to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , nevertheless he does not forgive the lies that one told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; at age 65 N@@ ene reti@@ res in retirement , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

first Nations teenagers use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip hop , thanks to a number of traveling workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten C@@ ree communities in North @-@ Que@@ bec and then with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in talks are subject to topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ ebo@@ j@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in West Can@@ ada , where almost two dozen young women mostly disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
&quot; at the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will forgive our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
&quot; in this way , they can do what they intended for the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and advoc@@ ates of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ ille ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the meantime , the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale : new plastic , decorated mobile tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial food items have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an Imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laughing stock is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say , &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members as unpleasant as possible . &quot;
our newest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter for the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; 1 &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; 1 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed completely into the background the stories of the victims of the conflict . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with drug trafficking &quot; ) which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how afraid of life &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who visits secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
&quot; Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she does not have an income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she also writes :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; it is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; open @-@ minded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family with threats was pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this , she describes how an armed criminals de@@ pressed money from her business month by month , but also tore up her family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want others to be arrested , as they do not know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked if I would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he saw just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence caused by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor numbered 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if one image is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people look at them . &quot;
but here history does not come to an end .
&quot; over the years the same photograph has been raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in the streets and bushes .
&quot; reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; a man said to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated figur@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the Bag@@ a military base was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented allocation to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments like this example wrong@@ ly illustrate the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a bl@@ itz report released by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , bringing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed that President &apos;s Th@@ an Being had said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein &apos;s being this statement , but had not related the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ tions reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded false reports , some others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have adopted examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which side they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have been inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully recovered ( on the map in orange ) :

country examples of false cop@@ per@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; gray @-@ gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to demonstrate counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; weather@@ ing contributions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; clearly have not seen sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even in Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shown as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used ab@@ u@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a judgment on what it was intended as &quot; visi@@ bly fin@@ alised news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this adjustment , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ ents that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein &apos;s 2012 admitted that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to contain it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Kath@@ olische Ker@@ ly near news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared , equipped with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and ret@@ arded more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message written in circulation by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared a false message . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and spor@@ adic@@ ally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) , which go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are lots of people who un@@ intentionally have a share of drinking water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this sen@@ timent of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used detached from context or completely mis@@ used type . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons use according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
&quot; such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sour da ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the vat cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get rid of your parents in recognition of how much effort you have made in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ ame other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite Sw@@ ings here . &quot;

&quot; as Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade , &quot;
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ all dropped on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on its way . &quot;
&quot; today , the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and five other five are ready to transport emergency deliveries for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ nec@@ cess@@ ary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than 1,000 requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring security and assistance to residents in need . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , and Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts to me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we are creating rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ esting slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has established itself in its conception . &quot;
they det@@ oxi@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we do differently our religion .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit into it , have to be reli@@ eved . &quot;
det@@ oxi@@ fication of the muscles
I &apos;m not alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come into the mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped out , as did the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the duk@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that Western books have been colon@@ izing for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to rely on them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , bad nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , who lead movements for change . &quot;
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it cle@@ ars the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has cast our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion are
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create sc@@ ars that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Palestinian Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , originating from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my im@@ migr@@ ated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh , named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan remembered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of picking up my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket dish , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated anti @-@ Islam machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which has manipul@@ ated our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is , or of what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger who pul@@ ls a woman the head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am a Muslim , if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the al@@ night ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms , and whis@@ per@@ ing her the Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Koran and called the q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an icon contest in Kar@@ achi , will eventually pose in the 1960s with her sisters . &quot;

&quot; belonging is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s mat@@ ernal side with her sisters , how they win a competition in the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ised through a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in half a century into his arms . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by colon@@ ists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy threat@@ ens the United States and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that , two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of 1,7 billion bears more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two @-@ ness &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this duality . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders from people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; , &quot; which mainly focuses on Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we disc@@ ard to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ an@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous print@@ outs we get in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an un@@ disputed Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that might aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to &quot; others . &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; enth@@ an@@ ised in the public performance four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices talked about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
&quot; for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies : &quot;
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while listening frequently it is connected to understanding &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; to listen to , to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their history in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is att@@ un@@ ed to it . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as though language no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ am@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to expand this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organise their own story@@ telling stories . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Rico &quot; &quot; calls for the US to re@@ establish state debt &quot;
&quot; with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the renewal of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests on public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to settle down with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the state alliance - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , the measures imposed on the outside are threatened by the people to be rejected by the people . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open grid . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture held in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist in the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books completed by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book aims to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge , and what is the real cost associated with it . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked alongside the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing that Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us have begun to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
&quot; however , his residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of B@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes was more fores@@ eeable than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything in it , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in detention . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I rings in every detail your voice and words
&quot; I am with passion with me , &quot;
if your eyes will say farewell
and I lay another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to get back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile on your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
its history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or buried under acts of violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption court @-@ condemned director for release again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a sei@@ zure of corruption , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants for em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million people ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose Council presi@@ ded over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who evaluated the application , there would be no grounds for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call this action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have introduced disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
&quot; the company seems to be silent , however , and does not indu@@ ce reasonable legal steps to apply the relevant functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; war@@ y &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had eaten . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly be paid for his silence . &quot;
re@@ fut@@ ed !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ ale and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself solely on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself was we@@ ary of that man who was pre@@ charged and ultimately sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered forever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambitions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious human being is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , spending 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he is making money , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ ы@@ д@@ у@@ щ@@ а@@ я с@@ т@@ а@@ т@@ ь@@ я &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mos@@ ambique th@@ ief and servant of the # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long term imprisonment , returns to # airports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ary aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ist believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
&quot; what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words &quot; &quot; next &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( stool ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to play , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automated cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech , but were nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post states &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring out balancing hate speeches on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age of marry is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this amend@@ ment of the marriage law , some members considered Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ man Mos@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age , did not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN &apos;s Convention on Child Rights , the Min@@ ors as defined , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married at 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 by 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were eager to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s wo@@ e , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who held up - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one single against it .
&quot; after he had previously agreed to the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of the children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , a Facebook member who lam@@ ents a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot; &quot; Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ gende says ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decre@@ ed .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independently of religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the draft on the amend@@ ment to the marriage law was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 depu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all depu@@ ties who were against had agreed to the law .
the children &apos;s toe is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ trap ag@@ ei@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our depu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be adopted , and he seems to deliver his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most of the social media users wish that the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather Sat when we , instead of keeping the discussion so general , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace if we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters , may be used to mis@@ use them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or continues to be the norm although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - however , it remained intact in the cache . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Public Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has now blocked the popular cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share information and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use uph@@ eav@@ als for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN presence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as illustrated recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform dropped all Turkish wi@@ ki@@ pedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer @-@ computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content , in spite of the legal prohibition , is available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we have everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a distributed and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as collabor@@ ators with Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast : &quot;
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; a moving rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; with the photos he saw around him , Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ring with poorly positioned motifs and washed @-@ out colors . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home town next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this top @-@ not@@ ch situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to gr@@ ind pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood by the tig@@ ers face to face with face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when the king of the book suddenly appeared . he immediately sets off , we see us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ tak@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is also not called by name , is also common among men . however , they have much less assignment to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , performed a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the disclosure of practices , such as child marriage to exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club . &quot;
she tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to speak out loud the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all have endu@@ red and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this until this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband in the name so far , wanted to try out at home as it is going . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese of the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she was gi@@ g@@ gling in front of her throughout the exercise , and another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the rush of adren@@ alin , having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the cin@@ ino@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think that they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip for every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini say :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them are okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ami @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tasted it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ bert on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives like the viol@@ a for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini proclaimed :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was fired by the &quot; &quot; h@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; ( The Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day ) on the Japanese t@@ witter @-@ trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . &quot; &quot; after 51 years , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; just today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies use the fan community in market terms , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; and eat no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
so the day will be gone today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; follow the h@@ ash@@ tag on the &quot; &quot; h@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; wait &quot; &quot; to learn more about the Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique , are worried about a new system of kidn@@ apping of cross @-@ headed persons for the organ trading , presumably for un@@ believing purposes . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently used to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; according to local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a man of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia spoke to the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men traveling to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned about the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique said that the local police had already been following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for prob@@ able rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed according to which the victims in the head might have power , the wealth generation . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
&quot; I would like to be attracted to E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ICH , a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets , as if they would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald @-@ headed persons would be hun@@ ted for un@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren recommendation . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the head of the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are sky@@ scra@@ pers : &quot;
the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murdered people .

we are deeply concerned about the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the creative com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public access to the Internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices Community and took part in our meeting of Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who had abandoned himself as the insi@@ der of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ tion &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we are doing the honour of Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , thus the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or disappeared forci@@ bly , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , the International Human Rights Organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably only recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ u case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman denied , however , to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an Declaration on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; wish him the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany and Germany
&quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Li@@ u received all the medical support he needed and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had large concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;

&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including freedom of speech , to uph@@ old and allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually record it . &quot;
Taiwan at the same time
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of Festival Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u and to demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means for political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; in a statement on June 28 , the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been strictly punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally deeply moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercising of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of the fact that he was inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the main point of the subject , the good old suff@@ erer emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leaving the distorted logic , since they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ rep@@ lies . &quot;
he tar@@ ried such questions with non @-@ answers in a rational way .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam@@ ous to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam@@ ous would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam@@ ously &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the address .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; rather than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an reveals his disappointment over Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is right associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review divi@@ des the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian angel ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since it plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam@@ ous are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do not defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; travel the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies like &quot; &quot; the defence of the country &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices just asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook inner rage when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind . &quot;
&quot; for someone who is not familiar , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country for ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means being sp@@ uri@@ ous - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can meet . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would go even so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; cute . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) , the band Tat@@ too Colour , describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend does . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular as regards the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives supreme decision making on important national issues to the supreme commander of the army . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; change the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear provisions are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was set up to supervis@@ e the online content and accused persons who were accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand has a strict commitment to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison terms , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the band &apos;s te@@ aser showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Asia Minor

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ hor@@ ical war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ en@@ ava are in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ cken of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ dul @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ho@@ stages . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 since it has barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ho@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
&quot; the buildings are deca@@ ying , and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot;

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only a paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plan economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ko , which still houses one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ suffici@@ ency ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to come over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as mentioned in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Asia Minor in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Asia Minor , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ thly Rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ ally Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , it reminds of the village fle@@ ets before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy is running past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball that goes down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball scre@@ aming .
&quot; while they are running , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for inno@@ c@@ ence in their lives . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 year old Mexican lover , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they begin to cry out : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you in Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they can &apos;t pay , she massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the way , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , the travellers consult their phones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who left . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she fli@@ cks in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ spots , who made her a kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile announcement in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web purification &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
the message is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information .
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after installing the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict zones , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , which published cens@@ ored messages in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked out whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are using a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are turned into electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Rules may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government departments , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from within and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to their name .
a person who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even when the Earth rot@@ ates on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone erected around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security service wor@@ ded it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were swept out of the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters sought , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands placed on a city that has been cra@@ mmed into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply in the district stopped functioning . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me , we united to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the ghost from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the security service .
I arrived there .
&quot; the colon@@ el of Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
the colon@@ el of Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only courageous enough to shout when we are not near .
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you &apos;re really sad to see me in the eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father , right away . &quot;
&quot; his father , right with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was suspended for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me . &quot;
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I plan all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise they have assigned me a bigger cell , this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with just one more prisoner , and I must put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating against the wall with the fist . &quot;
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; self @-@ help . &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there is no sign of any distinctive facial features , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers neg@@ ate its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be interro@@ gated immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these cro@@ ws , that are at the fruits in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13th Sh@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from releasing the betra@@ yers and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close field of vision of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he appears to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions he gli@@ des away : &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these days and protest at demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice inside me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the Klo@@ ppers .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
&quot; give it the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with it and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams did not give him enough , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a collector or whether this was part of the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , in order to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped shou@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no favour at all , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the space . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible things . &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and leave you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he shu@@ d@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the upper@@ most floor of his family house that belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ port . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and can sympath@@ ise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he har@@ bors a special dis@@ like against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian fled the second generation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think , because I &apos;m a person , &quot; &quot; while he poured in water @-@ dissolved Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hot young boy &apos;s day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sha@@ kes of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to end up in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled the performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and is the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
the depu@@ ties and former spokes@@ persons of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled due to the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the well @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an ever more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional sex organ by dra@@ fting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ es &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still further ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to fight crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be held in prison for in@@ definite time &quot; , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was hop@@ eful to me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb , the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is often repeated : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - either faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been greatly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn from the context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why could Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service holds several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they have been critical of the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ b concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he did not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , stre@@ aks and arti@@ ficially induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is believed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from western Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;

young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearances and personal care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in getting more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can reproduce these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unparalleled demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain a training in hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art instead of bad advice , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year commen@@ ced in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only primary school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for children . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; which published the international online magazine &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel em@@ b@@ ted to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga received exactly this question from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Bri@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we write to the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but forget those who need them much more urgently . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ á Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC were , as they had done earlier , to accept the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I was in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because beside him lying on the bed there was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; suddenly , I had tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him very tightly , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ elu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC gathered for a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice done by the state on the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard before and had no choice , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated even humans with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians have been prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take arms and protest and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now relying on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

&quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sums ova , whose first publication was published on the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community in the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , has not started just over night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published involving dra@@ gging , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , who threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities arrested and imprisoned in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she finally moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital last run .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and started shou@@ ting . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two keys in my right lung .
&quot; OC Media : in which case were you laid - in the men , or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and took me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having respect with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they made absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her : &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world not just your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a kn@@ ack around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a plate with a 95 on it . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought her without registering me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; we do not speak about sex equ@@ ation , however , this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; thus , I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : are men still gay in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not many .
&quot; if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to stand for Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there to present them as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked some village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this only a presum@@ ption , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown .
there was nothing new about them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think that already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to approach us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never even bent my hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply shut their eyes off you , because they believed you were ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , suddenly looked at you with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was constantly worsen@@ ing . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise tea meetings , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded breeding places .
I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; thus , nature has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bum@@ ps with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ians have what the cab@@ ard@@ inian have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I met so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transition to men who love males , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ kill@@ ings within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ h community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , revers@@ ed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ h community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to raise the incap@@ acity for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
&quot; some people made it quick to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ h minority in August , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have been hanging . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to live their families based on the persecution from the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ h suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi communities living in Iran have been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youngsters has now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General of Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Human Rights activist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has recently gotten worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs , and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ h must bear , human rights activists alert alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside .
&quot; for example , in spite of the same education women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms are still making sure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and denom@@ inations . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I am dou@@ bly and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic and hom@@ el@@ ands deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school are referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind which refers to both gender and skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer have to fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner lam@@ ented in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human@@ ely and margin@@ alized being in historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which moreover , through cultural appropri@@ ation , absorb our customs and customs , in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself full of femin@@ ism and join the movement of femin@@ ism , called for my dark skin and status as a woman , instead of taking me to a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
&quot; because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman , I am recognized as a part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither crossed , nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , poorly regarded sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ rin@@ ein ef@@ rau@@ bin ) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; police commission@@ er A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed ab@@ uses for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez made no use of the clear display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned to her advertisement . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever permit an ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 Be@@ atings and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that is not subordin@@ ate to 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , poor implementation of strokes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General issued 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came from . &quot;
&quot; in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who are ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse charges . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this are coming to any woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse charges . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 deaths in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want to do that , but she still gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . however , for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able : &quot;
I never thought I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , among them Carlos . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had left this for so long , and did not leave it earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; finally , her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began beating them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay Law : good approach , inadequate implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # fear@@ ing ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ ici@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the law text was changed in some points to also win the MEPs for the law who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions is denied , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are pun@@ ishable by up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply want to reimbur@@ se and obtain a safe accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the offen@@ ders of the offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation . &quot;
opinions on the changes are taking place .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the lining of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after ban on a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information .
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried before court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , following his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been suffering the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to restrict and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , even activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance case . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the head@@ line : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the Special Division and was arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , he held the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any road , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat was the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption in public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the Pres@@ ent of the State &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison terms and fin@@ es of 3000 @-@ Cuban Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dissemin@@ ate material which could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ania Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court pronounced Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central P@@ rison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he served his imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the Court &apos;s decision to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Japanese government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months and which the minister once again appe@@ aled to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been injured in the press room .
&quot; further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to : &quot;
1 . release you@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ der their ri@@ ghtful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : there are a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have a more serious impact in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research that is carried out by African scientists itself helps to build its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , where the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
&quot; in your opinion , what are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a mo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; the system , that magazines make articles accessible only for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many let@@ tu@@ ce varieties he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding .
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green shade or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or car@@ rot . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it takes longer , as his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der was lying around which I had to p@@ addle .
&quot; we must do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever larger in the U.S. and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red ro@@ asting let@@ tu@@ ce at the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that other seed @-@ bred seeds can freely use the seeds they have bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; Professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by raising seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers markets , it should also know that the way these vegetables are bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others , in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the growing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming more and more limited , shr@@ inks inc@@ ess@@ antly . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are still patented as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of perspective
&quot; plants are grown so that they are specifically desired features - from those with which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders is dimin@@ ishing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property protects other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees this in another way : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their job easier .
this is what drives us and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources .
Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we don &apos;t know how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds its own values in it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass @-@ produced her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders through avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks as if I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years , with which in my opinion it is quite simple . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be leading in Open Source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also helps them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col works on an open source license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation does not simply become one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled for scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around May 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above . &quot;
&quot; in August the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains consistent despite this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not to yield . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to the AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ory apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s block@@ ade and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in providing me with the feeling of a state of siege . arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now that they have locked him out and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courageous go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , af@@ te documented the blocking of vendors , through the transfer of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice points to the intention of the government to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by which it can proceed against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

&quot; day after day , newspapers in all Brazil are reporting dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smoking dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers to the army , nav@@ y and air@@ ship to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not civilians , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against den@@ ying violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , according to her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold ac@@ countable for the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro State .
&quot; if we look at the murder rates per federal state , Rio is in number 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the state &apos;s security policy . &quot;
&quot; these security policies also included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux selected from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio also causes serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this demands the state to employ means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; with which a civilian is an im@@ percep@@ tible point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war hin or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week now , it &apos;s time for the police to climb up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to take revenge on the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : taught Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 , called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which resulted in the population being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smu@@ g@@ gled food . &quot;
&quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ mics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not one of the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the diver@@ t of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to earn money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 04 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts of fire , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photographs , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal by 2017 alone - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts only .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portu@@ - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some pictures shared by Twitter users :

numerous videos spread on the web and show pictures that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did so nowhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the Wal@@ sh form , which the government had introduced after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had the means for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carried out in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environment organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , are still expanding , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , when citizens searched for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it util@@ ised its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .

the road from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

&quot; in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in G@@ haz@@ ni province in Central Africa . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was supposed to open . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly feeling vulnerable . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than himself , to make a living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af recalls in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon outside the open windows so we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran , and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy children twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true , though , that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively large quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which after the registration of the asylum application can still go for months . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af established his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operated by Afgh@@ ans , including d@@ ress@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have ar@@ isen . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals , however , reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy business and retailers and target back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also designs plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and learning techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end , stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
&quot; citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt permit the elimination of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo that prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
&quot; users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating its full name and ID number . &quot;
those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the payment of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which has been promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently in front of the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP presented a legislative proposal that would introduce har@@ sh@@ er sanctions for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , such action would , however , be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , it can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators , who were demonstrating against the military coup that led to the presi@@ dency of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; as more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for four years in jail for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison line failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si &apos;s seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gated documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by a tra@@ cked action plan . said plan was provided by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan expressly supported a controversial bill of law , which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption charges an am@@ nesty provided for all illeg@@ ally received funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans appear to support the legislative situation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating the article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their reference ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated in the regulations that the registration will be required with full real name . &quot;
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be achieved . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat with@@ drew from the state government as &quot; organis@@ er of dissemin@@ ating information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned by websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication provided that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information gathered with groups to join a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
