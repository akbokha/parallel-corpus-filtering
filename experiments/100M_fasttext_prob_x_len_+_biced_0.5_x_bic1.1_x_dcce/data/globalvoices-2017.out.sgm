<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free on Method Man," I was it, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I was living in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only increased."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I have ever lived in, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very schwäreric love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in multitudes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the nominated candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, the people from all over the world record, a deep faith man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also trump worldview did not correspond to that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits into the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Daney, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump was preparing his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"sorting out people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(note. Ü):" white against all other ethnicities "; word play from white in alluding to the whites and whiplash, which means so much like the big Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election Donald Trump, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had an exchange of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "screamed the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is Trump Land now, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banker violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI says:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga to play."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chavez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of reprocessed material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about 1 billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to run one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do", "Benedict Kiilu recalls, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and safeguards resources, was founded by FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stopping illegally fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "this means we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it concerns illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, actions are happening today in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, for example, news about suspicious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform has been created to reclaim USD 20 million in lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of fantasies, fish-protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system, "says Long." in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could say "You must not run my port." "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole attempts to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities, and it has tracked and found fled ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help the FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly being developed helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information to each other. it should help FISH-i to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Ocean Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of any traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - it simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project which allows a global system to prosecute ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without license earlier and hardly expected to face consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiriu says." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined forces to join the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's latest member state in Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it presented Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used towing nets, which are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship had also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, the proof that such a special, collaborative working method for protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by gathering in the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas area, in the Andes Mérida and Táchira, located in the central north-north of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the opportunity to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="199">"when he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="200">"as an adult man, Quijano now said against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I believed it was okay."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magic.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in the La Perla prison."</seg>

<seg id="213">"no, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father."</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">"when my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts."</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">"you are an asshole, you have friends with one of the ERP partners."</seg>
<seg id="221">Just that they will not guide you one day and I have to save you then.</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me waiting at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I stepped in and saw a Liege that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, outcast him with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>

<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - they were all tied at their hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people were cautiously sitting on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you kill me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">"they were cast into a pit, and were killed and buried by soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be moved."</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Revision of the original photo by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving licence, in the last month witnessed a very unsuccessful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word (koreisha), which means" older motorists, "was wrongly translated as" "terrible motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="350">"the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun's published daily newspaper wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable", "Holmes said."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the erroneous English translation was first removed. the term" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture excused for translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "awful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a reason for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the especially unnamed reporter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo for the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to have against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on Yahoo for translation errors, among other things, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "is this (" "terrible car" ") about not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "so erroneous is the translation actually not at all, isn't it?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread transmission of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and to convey active language skills in order to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still produce translations in the company. then, the Japanese co-worker, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the phrases and enigmatic phrases, created by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large corporations or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more thorough translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the Kyoto City will hopefully make use of a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride talking about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the shop is quite simple: a large family with little money leaves its underage son or her underage daughter to another, more wealthy family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke to Criadazgo, especially young girls, who had been affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated to the Criadis guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family that has her daughter in the faith that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and" "make something out of it", "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl with her and justifies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education, and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly after she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military master Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a police officer at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck with a stick on Marín until she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF and Callescuela made the Criadazgo practice deeply rooted in paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay there are more cows registered than children," "Tina Alvarenga complained."</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl, who was their Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>

<seg id="455">"the Criadis are not only exploited as labor, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market, to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time so that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time too was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she had never starved, but didn't eat unlimited food." I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house than food out of the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on "the regulations governing the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is mandated to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months by adopting the law, users must register on the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs across the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video messages and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not give a indication of how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall around Facebook. it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German" leading research scientist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), commented Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that, just as they forcibly control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to supervise the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislative of the Parliament and the Constitutional Committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military thought in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, reported the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to reconstruct the lives of those affected by the triple catastrophe in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring Fukushima and Iwate neighbourhood were forcibly evacuated, as the tsunami had lost whole coastal cities off the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"even so, the Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, and alone 160,000 people had to leave their homes alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo Special Report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in-the-war, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to see the greatest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, still, six years after the disaster, evacuated from accommodation quarters (in the south, casetsu juutaku), one still endeavoured to relocate to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the people evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuees were evacuated to homes after the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened its doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land."</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear "restricted zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but again Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level, as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only contain 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants have felt it more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey reported that 83.1 percent of the resident population, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture also witnessed the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 people evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were converted into permanent replacements."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated people are older than 50 years old. they are known to be capable of repairing Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games scheduled to take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It was two years since the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after succumbing, the sugar cane industry was still in the region and the factory lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete scaffolding remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuted daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>

<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back in operation, because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>

<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>

<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and were hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cree communities in North-Quebec and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in talks are subject to topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitebojkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section in West Canada, where almost two dozen young women mostly disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"at the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will forgive our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">"in this way, they can do what they intended for the Creator."</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the meantime, the" "Plastic Models of the dishes" ") are exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokier district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new plastic, decorated mobile tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>

<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigeration magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essences is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an Imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or laughing stock is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say," "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, in order to surprise colleagues or family members as unpleasant as possible."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries with itself."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed completely into the background the stories of the victims of the conflict."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning with drug trafficking") which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "how afraid of life" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who visits secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">"Guadalupe Contreras:" "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata."</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">He left the house on 13 October.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she does not have an income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She also writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone, and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"it is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified, that they were" "open-minded." ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the main town district: how a family with threats was plundered. "in this, she describes how an armed criminals depressed money from her business month by month, but also tore up her family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want others to be arrested, as they do not know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked if I would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potatoes, tortillas and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he saw just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as violence caused by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor numbered 3103 killings."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" wrong description "or" wrong context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died there."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "by Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows rows of stolen bodies, which are lined up on the ground while people look at them."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photograph has been raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in the streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "a man said to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were smashed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated figuratively."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the Baga military base was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented allocation to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments like this example wrongly illustrate the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a blitz report released by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, bringing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which falsely claimed that President's Than Being had said, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to depict this information."</seg>

<seg id="1138">"recently, Global Voices talked about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"for the creators of the project, the following applies:"</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening frequently it is connected to understanding" "these events instead" "to listen to, to feel, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers first introduce their history in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is attuned to it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as though language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamamara tells the Fabel of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his fabel, John Nyamara is asked," How is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organise their own storytelling stories."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the renewal of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests on public debts, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt, which is not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to settle down with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not integrated into the state alliance - is suffering from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Center for New Economy, "a non-profit non-profit organisation without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, the measures imposed on the outside are threatened by the people to be rejected by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture held in Berlin, dedicated itself to the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist in the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books completed by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book aims to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge, and what is the real cost associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked alongside the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing that Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us have begun to think about their own fate, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "Bassel had taken on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his residence and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bel's cultural prototypes was more foreseeable than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here the Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything in it, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1230">"that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace,"</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a seizure of corruption, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence, in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants for embezzlement of 54 million people (about 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose Council presided over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who evaluated the application, there would be no grounds for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call this action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have introduced disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company seems to be silent, however, and does not induce reasonable legal steps to apply the relevant functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" wary ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had eaten."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence."</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morale and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself solely on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself was weary of that man who was precharged and ultimately sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or splitting."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "by" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored in order to express their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, it is written in Burmese as' Kalar htaing 'which contains the same letters as well as other words like' Kalar pae ',' Kalar OAT '(Kamel) or' kalary aar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hist believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words" "next". ""</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(stool) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spreading hate speech, get a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to play, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post" did not meet the Facebook community standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automated censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech, but were nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>

<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to heighten the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out balancing hate speeches on his Burmese sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously approved a law to ban this practice, so that the age of marry is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"prior to this amendment of the marriage law, some members considered Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harryman Mossad Maharaj, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age, did not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting partner of the UN's Convention on Child Rights, the Minors as defined, every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics from the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were already married at 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 by 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, which were eager to abolish laws on children's woe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill in general."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who held up - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one single against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after he had previously agreed to the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>

<seg id="1360">"it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's almost worth every price."</seg>
<seg id="1361">"while Abel Jackson was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:"</seg>

<seg id="1363">The marriage law has been decreed.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 - 0 against it!!!!"</seg>
<seg id="1365">"Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:"</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years independently of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">"the draft on the amendment to the marriage law was decided today, on June 9, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies who were against had agreed to the law.</seg>

<seg id="1375">"however, a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, should the law be adopted, and he seems to deliver his promise."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"while the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate, if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most of the social media users wish that the debate on the subject would be different."</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">"rather Sat when we, instead of keeping the discussion so general, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace if we, instead of talking about the problem, that the state, our daughters, may be used to misuse them," would you then be ready to continue the discussion? "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">"however, whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children's marriage in different gradations is legal or continues to be the norm although there are laws that prohibit them."</seg>

<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share information and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use upheavals for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN presence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as illustrated recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, several mirrors pages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform dropped all Turkish wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer-computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content, in spite of the legal prohibition, is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we have everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a distributed and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia a.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"with the photos he saw around him, Sagar Giri was never satisfied. they were blurring with poorly positioned motifs and washed-out colors."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his home town next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this top-notch situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to grind pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he stood by the tigers face to face with face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when the king of the book suddenly appeared. he immediately sets off, we see us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalytaka and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a court and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives is also not called by name, is also common among men. however, they have much less assignment to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, performed a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the community video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the disclosure of practices, such as child marriage to exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was of women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak out loud the name of their husbands, is a custom that they all have endured and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband in the name so far, wanted to try out at home as it is going."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion club with this self-confidence in luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paese of the village Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she was giggling in front of her throughout the exercise, and another decided to release all the frustrated frustrations against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the rush of adrenalin, having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the cininoberred dot if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely with it, but think that they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip for every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to take care of who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini say:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them are okay, but some wanted to wear a salami-curta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnobert on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives like the viola for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini proclaimed:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">"on 29 June of this year, the hashtag was fired by the" "hashtag" "(The Beatles-Memorial Day) on the Japanese twitter-trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles."</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a turnaround in the Japanese culture of post-war years.</seg>
<seg id="1551">"the first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:"</seg>
<seg id="1552">"for just about five days, the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through."</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"the music of the cult band is" more than just a universal language like English, "Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review."</seg>
<seg id="1556">"good morning!" "today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan." "after 51 years, they were here in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">"and as it is for fans, Japanese of course make pilgrimages to the famous places associated with the band."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"if you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit."</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>

<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">"5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool"</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"just today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">"and of course, some companies use the fan community in market terms, such as this Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="1576">"good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!"</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of Zambézia warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"photo: different Bolin / Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="1585">"the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique, are worried about a new system of kidnapping of cross-headed persons for the organ trading, presumably for unbelieving purposes. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently used to use the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"according to local superstitions, that the head of a man of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia spoke to the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">"the persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">"attention to kahle men traveling to Mozambique are target ritual attacks, the Mozambican police warned about the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts."</seg>
<seg id="1597">"two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place."</seg>
<seg id="1598">"Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police had already been following the case:"</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of the fact that he was inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the main point of the subject, the good old sufferer emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, since they are better suited to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried such questions with non-answers in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugamous to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugamous would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugamously's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is rather a" city "rather than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan reveals his disappointment over Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is right associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review divides the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "benign a mistake" "or was it a Freudian angel?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugamous are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do not defend their city, but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"travel the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore, and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear testimonies like" "the defence of the country" "etc., but this is not quite correct."</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I'll answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook inner rage when they are held for Americans, but I don't mind."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who is not familiar, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means being spurious - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has his own Canadian double-goers)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can meet."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would go even so far, to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>

<seg id="1788">"take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 Rules of the Girl "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives supreme decision making on important national issues to the supreme commander of the army."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"cepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula. it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59 year old Mexican lover, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign for the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast, they begin to cry out:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medication they can't pay, she massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Mercalli who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the way, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the travellers consult their phones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who left."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she flicks in her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair-spots, who made her a kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeated them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile announcement in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" "Web purification" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">The message is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information.</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after installing the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict zones, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from mainland China "based on Twitter, which published censored messages in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked out whether they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are using a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" ("" "" "") also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computer and cell phones in Xinjiang are turned into electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Jingwang Rules may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government departments, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications."</seg>

<seg id="1998">A person who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will become aware of your existence, even when the Earth rotates on the axis of the evil. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone erected around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the boss of the security service worded it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"during a peaceful protest, five young people were swept out of the beautiful garden of our revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to crush the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all quarters sought, only my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands placed on a city that has been crammed into the arteries with state safety organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had a little calming after the power supply in the district stopped functioning."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, real friends joined me, we united to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you release the ghost from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "make you ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have screamed it all the way up to the office of the security service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the colonel of Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">The colonel of Ghassan starts speaking: "let me hear how you write" Allahu Akbar "or you are only courageous enough to shout when we are not near.</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you're really sad to see me in the eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I didn't think that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement and his father, right away."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, right with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence is still in my nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture that I was suspended for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in the first office, I leave everything I carry with me."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I plan all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"otherwise they have assigned me a bigger cell, this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with just one more prisoner, and I must put me immediately without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried method of communication: beating against the wall with the fist."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cellular comrade was a "self-help."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle-aged man who looks like me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, there is no sign of any distinctive facial features, and there are no doctors here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers negate its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will be interrogated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"the investigator had assured me, they would release him if I remain."</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would have liked to have a scarecrow to drive away all these crows, that are at the fruits in my head's garden."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from the distance I still hear them shouting" "Allahu Akbar". ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black was the color of perdition, until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person: the Raad (for example:" thunder, "alluding to 13th Shure of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was lifted: to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from releasing the betrayers and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - thus they played their denominational blackmail and betrayed the close field of vision of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, this is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he appears to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the expressions he glides away: "my boy, you're still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join these days and protest at demonstrations that will soon find an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice inside me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to make this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the Kloppers.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give it the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with it and you can't withhold your screams."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams did not give him enough, why they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had previously worked as a collector or whether this was part of the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined, in order to present us from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped shouting."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no favour at all, which is why he resorted to an electrically charged staff."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which seemed to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the space." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man:" "my Lord, my father has to worry about terrible things."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet, and leave you, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shudles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the uppermost floor of his family house that belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (about: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapport."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and can sympathise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he harbors a special dislike against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as" Palestinian fled the second generation. ""</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think, because I'm a person," "while he poured in water-dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hot young boy's day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the shakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to end up in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled the performance of the band Mashrou 'Leila for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and is the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokespersons of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that questioned the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an ever more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to Leibe's traditional sex organ by drafting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'honorary mores' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still further aggravated that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fight crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be held in prison for indefinite time", "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was hopeful to me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in Ghareeb, the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is often repeated:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words," get what you want "- either faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been greatly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn from the context, distorted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who later was to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why could Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service holds several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they have been critical of the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaib concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, streaks and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is believed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing marched over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from western Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we could grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fortresses are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearances and personal care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoke and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in getting more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these lavish hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unparalleled demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which takes place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain a training in hairdresser's art instead of bad advice, which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year commenced in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" declaration of love to guerrilla fighters, "which published the international online magazine" Tea After Twelve. ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel embted to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga received exactly this question from the Bogota Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Carta por la Briliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we write to the people we love, on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but forget those who need them much more urgently."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotá Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC were, as they had done earlier, to accept the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness, and everything that lies in between, "told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I was in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a sort of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because beside him lying on the bed there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "suddenly, I had tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him very tightly, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC gathered for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how the social injustice done by the state on the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard before and had no choice, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated even humans with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians have been prophesied that after disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take arms and protest and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now relying on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which hangs over the LGBTQ community in the LGBTQ community, has not started just over night."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published involving dragging, torture and killing queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta, who threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities arrested and imprisoned in secret prisons in argun."</seg>

<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had learned of the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she finally moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the lap through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on October 10, 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long will you still dishonour the family, you stain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital last run.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had received everything and started shouting."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keys in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which case were you laid - in the men, or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and took me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"for this, I am very grateful to him."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having respect with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they made absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her:" "they brought a monster to the world not just your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a knack around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with darkened windows and a plate with a 95 on it."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her without registering me, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe, you're in security just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"we do not speak about sex equation, however, this is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditionally Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"thus, I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">"OC Media: are men still gay in these secret prisons, too?"</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to stand for Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there to present them as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked some village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this only a presumption, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was there even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people, which belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think that already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to approach us to" "civilisation", "but finally thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never even bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply shut their eyes off you, because they believed you were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never chased and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had smiled and laughed before, suddenly looked at you with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was constantly worsening."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise tea meetings, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bumps with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestanians have what the cabardinian have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are them - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I met so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transition to men who love males, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of self-killings within the impoverished Arab Ahwah community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the past few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jasim Moramazi on August 27, reversed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwah community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to raise the incapacity for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people made it quick to clear the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ahwah minority in August, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have been hanging."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers, who were helpless and unable to live their families based on the persecution from the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwah suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a majority of the Arab Ahwazi communities living in Iran have been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from that wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to exacerbating the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youngsters has now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">Systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Human Rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has recently gotten worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs, and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their pre- and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwah must bear, human rights activists alert alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I don't identify with feminism even with the intersectional</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of the same education women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still making sure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and denominations."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am doubly and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices" "and" "sing Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and homelands deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school are referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind which refers to both gender and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer have to fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner lamented in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a humanely and marginalized being in historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which moreover, through cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself full of feminism and join the movement of feminism, called for my dark skin and status as a woman, instead of taking me to a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman, I am recognized as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither crossed, nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive then? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, poorly regarded subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques, with whose help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kurtural. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# refrinein efraubin) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"police commissioner Ada Báez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-spouse, who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another wife of Balbuena showed abuses for mistreatment, Ada Báez made no use of the clear display of Ada Báez."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned to her advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever permit an ad, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 Beatings and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that is not subordinate to 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, poor implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General issued 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of women's advertisements came from."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the adverts, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "there are 9 women who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse charges."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this are coming to any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse charges."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's suicide in Paraguay is not an offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 deaths in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">A sign with the inscription: "without complicity no impunity. # Unless" photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she did not want to do that, but she still gave up. this should be regretted for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. however, for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, among them Carlos. he asked rhetorically, if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had left this for so long, and did not leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay Law: good approach, inadequate implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament under the hashtag # Porellas (# fearing)."</seg>

<seg id="2552">"Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, public liberties, including freedom of the press, to restrict and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens, even activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on site: there are a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a more serious impact in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research that is carried out by African scientists itself helps to build its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, where the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"in your opinion, what are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?"</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a mover."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic education, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines make articles accessible only for payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many lettuce varieties he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green shade or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carrot. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer, as his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder was lying around which I had to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"we must do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever larger in the U.S. and throughout the world: open Source Breeding (" "Open Source" "breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red roasting lettuce at the "glasshouse" of the station. it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that other seed-bred seeds can freely use the seeds they have bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." "open source" "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by raising seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers markets, it should also know that the way these vegetables are bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others, in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the growing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming more and more limited, shrinks incessantly."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates do not exist for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that large-scale plants such as wheat are still patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown so that they are specifically desired features - from those with which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders is diminishing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts, however, that intellectual property protects other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this in another way: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we don't know how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety, also breeds its own values in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass-produced herbicides are needed, bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders through avoiding plant patents would be more innovative:" it looks as if I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years, with which in my opinion it is quite simple." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be leading in Open Source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open source license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation does not simply become one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" open source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled for scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report published by McKnight Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly focused on where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Qatar for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider of which is also home to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blockade and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded in providing me with the feeling of a state of siege. arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now that they have locked him out and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>

<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by which it can proceed against these acts."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in all Brazil are reporting dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves smoking drugstore with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers to the army, navy and airship to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" Extra "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial" This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>

<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not civilians, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harms more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against denying violence as a" war.

<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>

<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which resulted in the population being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smuggled food."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not one of the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the divert of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements."</seg>

<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 04, 2017."</seg>

<seg id="2818">"due to the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy."</seg>

<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Ghouta for free."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts of fire, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photographs, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal by 2017 alone - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts only.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"according to Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did so nowhere: there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the roads were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal to the Walsh form, which the government had introduced after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was objected by the communes who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had the means for self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval carried out in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environment organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees of easily inflammable wood, are still expanding, as in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October, when citizens searched for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it utilised its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade and was so crucial that the server did not stand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a cohort pit. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, who were heavier than himself, to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," "Asharaf recalls in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon outside the open windows so we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran, and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy children twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true, though, that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively large quotas. it is true, however, that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which after the registration of the asylum application can still go for months."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible way of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf established his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2913">"according to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of Afghans operated by Afghans, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have arisen."</seg>

<seg id="2933">"users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after successful law decision on the authority's website, stating its full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the payment of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which has been promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently in front of the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another MP presented a legislative proposal that would introduce harsher sanctions for the insult of the president or a senior official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the legislative proposal, such action would, however, be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"if the law is passed, it can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstrators, who were demonstrating against the military coup that led to the presidency of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"as more than 700 protesters who had been arrested in the same incident, Shawkan waited for four years in jail for a trial."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison line failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a Criminal Court in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting on pro-Morsi's seat block on the Raba'a Al-Adaviya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who co-founded the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by a tracked action plan. said plan was provided by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan expressly supported a controversial bill of law, which would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption charges an amnesty provided for all illegally received funds."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, published on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans appear to support the legislative situation."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources, stating the article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to submit their reference?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in addition, it is stated in the regulations that the registration will be required with full real name."</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be achieved. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect the citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat withdrew from the state government as" organiser of disseminating information. ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"this term is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the" publication of information. ""</seg>

<seg id="2966">"it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">"after this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"the government has consulted telcos and intelligence services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside."</seg>
