that is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published a spectacular publication that the NSA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has investigated Ris@@ en and prompted him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First A@@ mend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en had a risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though , for years , it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government at Ris@@ en were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can hide more and less .
&quot; instead of failures and ris@@ ings to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone cards secret , &quot;
&quot; as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel statements with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitu@@ tions , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take it from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that still didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology has been developed by Secure@@ Drop , an open source payment system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I am working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post Office . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; this will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to make sure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to mis@@ judge mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental co @-@ worker , the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der , who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest database of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we guess Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Mos@@ ul Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
&quot; now that sounds like the plot of an agent , or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot;
&quot; it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very confusing to this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting also that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans , who occurred in these revelations , this scandal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ ul Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some U.S. states you need less information , less information must be given to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed dec@@ ei@@ vers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 legal firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator came out as an African minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal .
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
&quot; this may sound very stub@@ born , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen an increase in transparency regarding the ownership of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the fake companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and watching my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enth@@ r@@ alled how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to go ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot space !
&quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a stranger sleep@@ eth in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sle@@ ek at the toe at the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure , our Che@@ ese ham O@@ mel@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
&quot; my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business , allowing strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you put yourself on the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than appearance and hap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; for example , most of the guests feel that they sleep somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like this , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is a candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour first presented himself with his name ; if he had told him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can hold fast un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system enhances confidence .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust people the most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation encourages com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you cost yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! &quot; I make my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces to strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is just very good . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when things aren &apos;t going smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think only of it .
the disappointment we heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; when confidence works , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running off . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and this changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood where you have never heard of it ; &quot;
or if you could learn to cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we were to arrange apartments from the ground up to another ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; this project has already started in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
were offered residents . students looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children had been moved out , with incub@@ ator programs started , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as we were taught .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from Happ@@ iness and Tim@@ ing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think it &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives over to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use in the future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay when checking back at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ c@@ ass @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not how Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist independence statement for me , and compared to the pressure that I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was faith and slow devotion which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves you ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should this be done ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
the same day we had to travel through the mid@@ west of the USA to go to a new city and begin with post@@ graduate studies .
&quot; I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- as deep as I went to my seat , and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations who said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sil@@ enced . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week indoors .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; and again the warnings arrived : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the comprehensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged into the open and beat . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the United States .
the question is : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic Games . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spots , but not stopping terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant towards people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington DC region , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when it comes to the radic@@ alisation process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some people are still claiming that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would fit into their imagination by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they don &apos;t do what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual man with whom she had spoken , made her silent and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a major goal of the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
she learned what she learned in the mosque and kept it from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we happen at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if test persons are presenting news , in which neg@@ atively reports about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the allocation of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the faculty of dental medicine , talented , promising ... &quot;
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est and most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; when did my brother become such a sav@@ age young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he hur@@ ried to De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we were silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , and pulled my shoes off , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw made me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , athei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion in panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t fool . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for industrial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air packages have penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ date structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be found at the highest level . e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter what position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts , which get together to hurt you . &quot;
decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ holi@@ er , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross rods , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside living much happens so that it can fly stable , and can move in the room everywhere . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right when everyone is watching me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ holi@@ er is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be set in models , the rest is learned directly during flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at it .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this turns in clock@@ wise direction
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expressions . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , over there , would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the wage is in development and creativity . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy . they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars along all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first classi@@ fy the events .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is up to us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of specially brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise from col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ cked the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , this was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , a theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravity waves of black holes for 23 years and their readings , like Lig@@ o , meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a strengthening in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and moved into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lecturer in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a truly alpine dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each one of us was stretched and dug by us when the waves hit the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be precisely measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . that is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of the Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in tones , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that you particularly mean : &quot;
for the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties , such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sil@@ mm@@ ers Bob , &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; with them , we cannot produce simple images of objects in space . &quot;
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , ind@@ ented into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s Sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the bars of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; on this path , we can listen to the All and hear the invisible . &quot;
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through since these are op@@ a@@ que .
&quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own reflection . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in space that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt of things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the suction tubes for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o offers us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to begin with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , on an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my smallest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; che@@ ek@@ y , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; saw for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , stir up to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I &apos;m watching TV . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts at the same time : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I don &apos;t just dream about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a result , you get a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous , intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the hum@@ ming that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began to work and to work and make , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the hum@@ ming ! &quot;
the hum@@ ming is more than writing .
the hum@@ ming is action and activity . the hum@@ ming is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive other than size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I was not for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things happen at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I only this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ drive , burned out . &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase @-@ titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , you love what you &apos;re doing , a teacher , a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the hum@@ ming when the hum@@ ming stops , who is one ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone any more .
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ mon@@ ing , I cannot do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pens and the song in which it is going to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly returns .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the Tit@@ an@@ um sum , that is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the hum@@ ming is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
&quot; the sums are the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic from all guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t really care about how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we move around in the garden , before and forth , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly rigid , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ man or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
&quot; and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes by piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no under@@ wear , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own kids .
&quot; in order to play &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and save it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more .
&quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why not treat it for 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the hum@@ ming came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; it is me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium before , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I listen to the bu@@ zz . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the hum@@ ming of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life is in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , I resur@@ rect you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s suffer@@ ers who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; they must imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mas are infected by the brain , and the pressure of cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save lives , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by it ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; it is necessary to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to succeed . &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we cl@@ ung to the point of view of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- car transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we saw the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; here , of course , we could not stop . &quot;
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the mot@@ oric area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and later use them .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore it in man .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority permit us to start soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
&quot; first , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable facts .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to continue believing that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are wrong , we could save the democracy but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are bl@@ amed , our future dark@@ ens and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which throws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash that is part of the wealthy as@@ par@@ ag@@ us and corporations that are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income , with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth produced goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time run around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summ@@ its , which are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand that fear@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . &quot;
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances leading to the killing of O@@ edi@@ pus .
that is my coat with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , further develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor , as a majority , control the government . &quot;
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive which gave them the right to political participation in questions of the state of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is burnt quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations , became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , gradually under@@ mining politics and escap@@ ing it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power , because the power is im@@ migr@@ ated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , who so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that har@@ ms politics so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls , and the general managers of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin summ@@ its , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , just like in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
&quot; the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago , and it was not very good . &quot;
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summ@@ its higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a dise@@ ased monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and proceeds deri@@ ve from revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of trade in the respective country . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , in particular against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is liber@@ ally , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we awake in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you do not work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supp@@ er of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- the sector of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; that is to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant denial that a massive rejection of the euro zone has passed , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the occasion , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ounce the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live in life by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be possible for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example , Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- serious ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister or a minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sponsors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been implementing a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed on us this policy , said : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not only have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to step into the way of a post @-@ modern 1930s which appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; we have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 , and the amount shows how many shows will receive this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average coverage , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows , he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things free of charge , one is attacking , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pped or look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked towards . &quot;
&quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team have looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews that they give to the shows , the course of which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they embark@@ ed on a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years in statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we are taking more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not discharge occurs . &quot;
&quot; just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced by experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these mistakes , data streams increasingly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ inable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first break this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been able to do . however , the decision how to take all of these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget this device , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a yes or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; however , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with some much more sophisticated ones , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
