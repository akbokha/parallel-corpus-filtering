<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">"you might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter."</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published a spectacular publication that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has investigated Risen and prompted him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen had a risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though, for years, it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government at Risen were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failures and risings to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, kept his telephone cards secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit, and even travel statements with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his arrival, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutions, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take it from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that still didn't exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology has been developed by SecureDrop, an open source payment system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I am working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post Office."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"this will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to make sure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to misjudge misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental co-worker, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest database of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens] [what does this mean?] [we guess Robert Palmer of Global Witness] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Mosul Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now that sounds like the plot of an agent, or a John Grisham novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing to this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting also that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans, who occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mosul Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some U.S. states you need less information, less information must be given to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed deceivers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 legal firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator came out as an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very stubborn, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a secure optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen an increase in transparency regarding the ownership of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us in Global Witness, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and watching my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthralled how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while paying the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to go abducted in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself saying," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleepeth in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sleek at the toe at the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our Cheese ham Omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former mate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business, allowing strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you put yourself on the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked phone to your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"for example, most of the guests feel that they sleep somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like this, who actually has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is a candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour first presented himself with his name; if he had told him where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can hold fast unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system enhances confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust people the most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's reputation -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation encourages commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you cost yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle works of art in your apartment! "I make my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is just very good."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when things aren't going smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I think only of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment we heard in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, miracles can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running off."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but to call it simply" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood where you have never heard of it;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to arrange apartments from the ground up to another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of shared part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"this project has already started in South Korea's capital Seoul. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered residents. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children had been moved out, with incubator programs started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as we were taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from Happiness and Timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think it's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use in the future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay when checking back at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a carcass-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not how Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist independence statement for me, and compared to the pressure that I was 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was faith and slow devotion which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should this be done?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..." "..." "in the name of Islam...", ""... "jihad..." "..." "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu, the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to travel through the midwest of the USA to go to a new city and begin with postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- as deep as I went to my seat, and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations who said:" be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Remain in well-lit areas, "" Don't be silenced. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings arrived:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the comprehensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, dragged into the open and beat."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question is: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spots, but not stopping terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant towards people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington DC region, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when it comes to the radicalisation process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people are still claiming that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imagination by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they don't do what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was just the opposite. every spiritual man with whom she had spoken, made her silent and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a major goal of the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">She learned what she learned in the mosque and kept it from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if test persons are presenting news, in which negatively reports about Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the allocation of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the faculty of dental medicine, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest and most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my brother become such a savage young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He hurried to Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took it out, and pulled my shoes off, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had taken courage and compassion in panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for industrial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packages have penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up-to-date structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found at the highest level. e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter what position the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts, which get together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospholier, the mechanically most remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross rods, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside living much happens so that it can fly stable, and can move in the room everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right when everyone is watching me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospholier is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight proellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be set in models, the rest is learned directly during flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expressions."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the particularly safe machine, over there, would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, the wage is in development and creativity."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy. they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit brighter than all stars along all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first classify the events.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life on Earth was created."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is up to us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of specially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise from colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following years, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves rocked the two colliding black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, this was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravity waves of black holes for 23 years and their readings, like Ligo, measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a strengthening in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and moved into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturer in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a truly alpine dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each one of us was stretched and dug by us when the waves hit the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be precisely measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of the Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to say, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in tones, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that you particularly mean:"</seg>
<seg id="512">For the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties, such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"silmmers Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">"with them, we cannot produce simple images of objects in space."</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transmute wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, indented into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's Sound] Anyone who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the bars of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this path, we can listen to the All and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the Big Bang is covered by his own reflection."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in space that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt of things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the suction tubes for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo offers us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried out an experiment."</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, on an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my smallest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"cheeky, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" saw for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think of things, stir up to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I'm watching TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV-season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days, four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself and not only produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I don't just dream about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, you get a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous, intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the humming."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the humming that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work and to work and make, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the humming!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The humming is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The humming is action and activity. the humming is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can't strive other than size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I was not for failure, and I only know that I love the humming."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things happen at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the humming, the humming, the humming."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the humming.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overdrive, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase-titanium,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the humming.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're doing what you're doing, you love what you're doing, a teacher, a mom, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the humming when the humming stops, who is one?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way to the outside, late and she says," "Mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" estimating. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone any more.</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of summoning, I cannot do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax pens and the song in which it is going to release, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly returns.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the Titanum sum, that is only the substitute."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The humming is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums are the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am doing this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from all guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't really care about how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person prefers to work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we move around in the garden, before and forth, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly rigid, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladyman or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more it does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no underwear, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the humming, to have a place for peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own kids.</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to play" "games" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and save it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">You want to play? "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to outperform myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the piece, why not treat it for 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The humming came back in my spare time. the humming seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the humming, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a titanium before, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I listen to the buzz. the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the humming, the humming, the other, the right humming: the humming of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life is in me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think of things, I resurrect you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have one of the most well-known ones, the" "deep-brain stimulation". "in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's sufferers who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they must imagine that brain-brain traumas are infected by the brain, and the pressure of cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save lives, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells, which can turn into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we clung to the point of view of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we saw the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, of course, we could not stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motoric area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just like with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore it in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone."</seg>

<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable facts.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abolish if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to continue believing that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are wrong, we could save the democracy but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are blamed, our future darkens and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that is part of the wealthy asparagus and corporations that are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income, with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time run around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summits, which are not equalled by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand that fearing the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances leading to the killing of Oedipus.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my coat with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, further develop human talents, and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor, as a majority, control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it applied to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive which gave them the right to political participation in questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is burnt quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations, became a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, gradually undermining politics and escaping it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of carnivores, who so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that harms politics so far that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls, and the general managers of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" Demos "from democracy, the higher the twin summits, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, just like in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">"the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago, and it was not very good."</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summits higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reconstruct the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a diseased monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film" matrix "appear as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to that in" matrix, "in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopie? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and proceeds derive from revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of the whole of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "-- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of trade in the respective country."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, in particular against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is liberally, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awake in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, what Larry Summers described as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you do not work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supper of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- the sector of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"that is to say goodbye to the complacency, and the constant denial that a massive rejection of the euro zone has passed, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the occasion, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live in life by political will and authoritarianism, it may be possible for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">"BG: for example, YV: anyone looking back -- serious..."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or a minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the renewal of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sponsors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been implementing a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed on us this policy, said:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not only have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to step into the way of a post-modern 1930s which appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"we have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10, and the amount shows how many shows will receive this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to underline" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average coverage, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows, he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things free of charge, one is attacking, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skipped or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom via four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked towards."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team have looked at the available data about the Netflix Viewer, so the reviews that they give to the shows, the course of which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they embarked on a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years in statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is a bit frightening because we live in a time in which we are taking more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not discharge occurs."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced by experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these mistakes, data streams increasingly into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first break this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to put pieces and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been able to do. however, the decision how to take all of these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards, "was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team met this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order not to forget this device, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a yes or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with some much more sophisticated ones, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
