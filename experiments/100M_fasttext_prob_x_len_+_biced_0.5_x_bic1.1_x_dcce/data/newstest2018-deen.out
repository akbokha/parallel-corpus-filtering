Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish prison where young people should meet today .
&quot; a chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich fo@@ sters exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ navigation system was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work rug which is not recognized as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called original compositions , were incorporated into cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first sur@@ veying in Bavaria . &quot;
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the early 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical recording of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops moved away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
the foundation sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
&quot; the comparison Fru@@ her / Today , for example , is the most impressive example of the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , in the district of Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; prim@@ eval &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots there are no longer farmers there - but farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the venue of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was born . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - a psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to death by King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use force against occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients first place was first place , later extended to 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity did not suff@@ ice any more - the reason for the construction of the circular mill in the hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Institute .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; to the west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , Small Business H@@ ouses and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) race track will take place . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
Om@@ bud@@ sman published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; the National Union for Sup@@ porting Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to win discri@@ min@@ atory law@@ suits , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star , said , because of their skin colour . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney Office , which is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be prepared to bring a deposit or know the relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the German parliament members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have obtained a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fishing association CD@@ U met together with may@@ ors Thomas Schneider and the two depu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest &quot; milk &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste there is exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the green land area cares for much work , much must be edited with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and used it without chemical pesticides and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot;
&quot; at the expense of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion .
a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 via the electric fence .
&quot; the maintenance area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted via leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphas@@ ised : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and rural women . &quot;
also for Peter Weiss was certain : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Line Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding for pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; moreover , the f@@ enced area may not be tractor @-@ deduc@@ tible ( slope of 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing tackle project 2018 , there is currently an application of eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have lied to him if he had done it .
&quot; but he gra@@ bbed the meaning and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your afflicted masses , who lon@@ gs to breathe freely , the miserable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when &quot; miserable garbage &quot; was better to see on our screens .
he did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by depicting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself has a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great shou@@ ting R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the prospect that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever like to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch will not ligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland is something special &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there &apos;s something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there &apos;s something to do with what they did .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is fairly modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that you should watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; extremely proud &quot; &quot; in the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and at the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers have voted for me and have chosen me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to platforms . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate elec@@ ting voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he compla@@ ined in the criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skil@@ ful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum designated as officially designated and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ ps online .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the govern@@ ors of the Gover@@ nor designated as a &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably name others &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or being deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als , or to arrest prot@@ esters and silence them . &quot;
but exactly this just happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters kno@@ cked on his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and Navigation with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are part of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the final round in the Arch@@ er@@ field last year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he established this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since they were taken out of the program in the year after I had won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on his home floor . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish presence ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad how it has gone so far .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eil . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , there are 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the v@@ ill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the building company Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is a lot of snow in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which continuously hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the hau@@ ling company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the scheduled buses are eligible for transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reign in the in@@ calm Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was accepted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned to the Jak@@ arta Government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 hour drive with the car . &quot;
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust in different yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ ed a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua Indonesia is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua New Zealand has wood resources worth 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars in local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Cuban demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gn@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 years have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal country in the 1970 @-@ s were genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we ad All &quot; &quot; In a report from the dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the bolts have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 out of 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta ) . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ligh@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened kids told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their sound and later came back with four soldiers , thus the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting arches and performed the Wa@@ ita dance in a circle and im@@ itated a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started dra@@ gging stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says the TI@@ ME official document not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks later , in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he would establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ ran@@ to , accused of &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; charged with more than 1,000 victims in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody Declaration of In@@ dependence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with fierce in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian police ) began shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , such as the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest of the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua , attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a , fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; often , Papua people have the capital or the necessary skills to compete in their own businesses . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ al Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a plot close to the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is sweeping through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is rightly called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and when the people scre@@ am .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant named George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building following its fire in 2015 revealed that the greatest part of the damage from facing , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said she believed that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the revolutionary proposal for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single is only on two raff@@ les , waf@@ er @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but also therefore highly este@@ emed five @-@ set classics remain unchanged to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , it was not until the vote that the proposal came before the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements for training stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited objects to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knife or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travelers are more likely to dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents stated that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said it consul@@ ted travelers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gel@@ hop@@ pers had brought smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ding through airport security , and how many of them had intentionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who wear smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry security , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure what liquids they may take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers will cancel order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far been suggest@@ ing that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ increasing numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less brilliant figure for the first time in the publication of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often adver@@ tised over 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are present , mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500,000 will be one million in 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently being made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines , never tested in practice , with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with one year , to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ uted by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or dela@@ ying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal back@@ lash for the P@@ ru@@ ster regulatory rolling back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply suggested the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often has not adher@@ ed to the deadlines for implementing and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ pp , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority we give to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt sometime use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week said that the Group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the 6th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documentary documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; according to the certificate of the certificate , on the Tum@@ lingen hill , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard belonging to which the Church or the patron law belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the most beautiful sett@@ ling nucleus of the village . &quot;
&quot; ancient maps dating back to 1600 , under@@ pin these historical circumstances . &quot;
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , equipped and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church . &quot;
&quot; in this connection , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows and the bell were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ lingen Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and the half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the present tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care for Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organizers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local ruler Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann calls the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is available from 3.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; to conclude the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers have the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system which is of significance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini reinfor@@ ces . &quot;
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the land council . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there was a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones will prevent the landscape from being spar@@ ed .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still illegal and therefore rejected , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a licence for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out legally . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the call .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokesman . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself with regard to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are estate . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the power requirement of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg region .
car and tractor crashing together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more people were injured slightly .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her car as accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and De@@ aler plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure residents to shopping in the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the inner city invite to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; with this , the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; as well as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; for the well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the inner city when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to help rein@@ vigor@@ ate the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
king in the spring told me to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly spread .
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , informed that the third &quot; &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in the first time in Thurin@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchase behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were hurt .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire department , on Wednesday ( local time ) an infrin@@ gement was still in critical condition . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed .
&quot; a first missing , later , was also found dead . &quot;
at the dead it was an employee of the school .
&quot; as a matter of accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , after pier@@ ced tran@@ scripts from phone calls Mexico , put pressure on the payment of the border wall &quot;
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp requested a telephone interview with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president pla@@ gu@@ ed him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; tur@@ f started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and sw@@ or to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US , who emig@@ rated to Australia , was &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; &quot; dump &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull : &quot; this is the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip procession - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience beat very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous by the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of post@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights advocate that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer election campaign . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach upon data of the FBI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore was not her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they came from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ cted evidence and has disgu@@ ised the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their depic@@ tion is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that in America it does not exist any more . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and hard to see , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because then we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; thunder@@ ed one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive hydr@@ ation every eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s bodies . &quot;
&quot; children sitting on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears away .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gged Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona reco@@ vers two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in her arms ; the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sett@@ les together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta talks about the post @-@ delivery with a black couple that they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words leaving a feeling of performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do those because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone broo@@ ks at his table , he eats and reminds of citizen &apos;s rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the position is inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ aded street corner with the wall of the wall and the D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; poster and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ lea@@ thers pose as rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed barrels of oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which goes through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she seduc@@ ed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ce ) , and in Hollywood Man@@ ier put a cor@@ pse into the trunk and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the splen@@ did@@ ly nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) must also believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ce and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , who humble himself and de@@ fle@@ cted the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; in 2013 he had to have had a bearing whi@@ stle @-@ concert about himself , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went under . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of whose view has grown . &quot;
I draw a positive summary .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year right in several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in stone s@@ ling in the furniture market , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at the school in the open all @-@ round day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ employed volunteer . &quot;
how does that happen ?
amount : I did a SL@@ C .
&quot; and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different , working with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing ?
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on location , in the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
is it not something unusual to have several different locations during the volunte@@ ering service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really happened .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; amount : well clear , here it &apos;s not about calculating the static charges . &quot;
there are always other people who have a different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been squee@@ zed out of the family - you have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son announced on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , which General Manager John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nato and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and announced a NATO Declaration .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the subur@@ b of Q@@ arab@@ a@@ h . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ a@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it sh@@ red the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to set the o@@ zone regulations - in which parts of the country need to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year to October 2018 .
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colom@@ bian district , filed suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive back a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp would boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the demo@@ crats and nature groups &apos; set@@ backs that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and improve respiratory symptoms , &quot; &quot; as asthma . &quot;
community wants common space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : at two votes the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ kler appro@@ ves the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , it will continue until the area of the congregation is still owned by the church community , but there is now no obstacle to planning a project from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a common area . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly enter into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be determined by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolutions are to indicate to the investor that in this respect , there is no stick between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as a pul@@ t@@ roof - which would reduce the height and make the construction more economical - are possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not mean that this is the addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the committee . &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one can &apos;t move so well , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not doing it hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but receives a real , in case of doubt a market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ zione &apos;s motion to make the decision accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that summ@@ ari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist is thrown onto the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way to Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg at 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger @-@ driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he apparently did not ach@@ eive on the opposite traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that led a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ tu@@ rel carriage .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German football record champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger at Titan Poker &apos;s Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund Cup . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti doesn &apos;t have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
migr@@ ate in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes contrary to the need for information for many visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase by 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ sel and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location choice . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the turn of the star is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why one star would shine more than another , although they could be far further away . &quot;
I will also tell you in which con@@ stellation a selected star appears and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates at the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Natural Security , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Plan@@ etary Association of Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ ship - the planetary path in the Uni @-@ Stadt . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to down@@ gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away and measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year . &quot;
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to put the most exciting pit stop in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super spring weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former body@@ weight , &quot; &quot; recalled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended to Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move on light weight counter &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans ask .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate questions asked if it should be on pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title battle in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans asked for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later openly expressed his willingness to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; and he may be participating in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks , the three combat champion from River@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... You wanted to co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show the impact , then boxes . &quot;
they both said they could sense the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ter
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle just before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car was dra@@ gged to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green belt . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the North for about an hour , and then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping after 2 : 2 for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig for optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the first match of the season , with the result that the two opponents were not at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a breach , the For@@ tun@@ ers also don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no one else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain @-@ chain after the experience in preparation with the four @-@ chain chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in the structure . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about that .
&quot; I judged the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ y , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Radi@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are now , &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday enter the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; says funk , whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t , arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ y wants to not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
recent findings from testing for asylum seekers in Sweden undergoing a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began performing the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age . &quot;
&quot; up to now , migration verk@@ et 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old .
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the requested person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were going earlier or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it safe , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs fine , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of the department of road and traffic in the district office of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three re@@ building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the end of the building is planned for October , and Easy is sure that the schedule is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sandstone .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach left on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
&quot; this is a border attachment , which is also used as operating mode . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should go .
&quot; the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre cable where many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective wei@@ her towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the costs for the three brid@@ ging lines amount to 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ ja forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; the city picnic was originally planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; great , as many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; age @-@ German potato salad which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , they show presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ eland is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; also : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle some speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ person Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; about 200 listeners in the hall are waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ der , and the vice @-@ president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to speak their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but until now , the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can press down - no special incidents .

together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo osi@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall piece of art . &quot;
this core piece of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try it all , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that &apos;s cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I had been . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ eded .
I only liked it not to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school time when she &apos;d rather dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thou@@ ght@@ ings ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a declaration on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us from working in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , inclusive message , &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot;
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin told during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were caught in competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored Dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ sufficiently and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; funeral ceremony for soldiers , stri@@ cken in Mali &quot;
&quot; at a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; for an even un@@ explained breakdown , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they called the two inver@@ ted pilots , but as &quot; keepers of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen have died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the branches laid down roses , the relatives standing arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen , did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried alongside his wife after his death . &quot;
it shared the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal pair is traditionally attached to the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue his communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired , taking the title &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always inter@@ tw@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a severe stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals in this country , I could not hope for for@@ bear@@ ance . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is not willing to res@@ ign after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country &apos;s day , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens depu@@ ties from their country parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its bon@@ y one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ we@@ et founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group leader , Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants his Group to take up . &quot;
&quot; with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green government must now decide whether to be able to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , believes that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible its self @-@ dissolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also stipul@@ ates that the Land@@ tag draws trust and chooses a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options need to be properly tested , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in silence all questions are discussed , if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ we@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as an en@@ chan@@ cell@@ or of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land parliament .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they return their land trade , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ails extraordinary . &quot;
she decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even in the context of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ails to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Socialist and Democrats Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ we@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony with@@ draws this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to beat political capital from it .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to commend his MPs to include El@@ ke T@@ ails into the CD@@ U .
&quot; in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the results of the 2013 country election with a personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal be done ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks and answer . &quot;
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from po@@ ison@@ ous eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; in spite of this , my house immediately switched off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; as the manufacturers are concerned , trade has to ensure that the sold products are bu@@ si@@ le and safe to health . &quot;
&quot; if the residual maximum content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not able to transport . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the farms are to blame .
are manufacturing facilities and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must expect economic damages due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little controller in the case of a serious incident . &quot;
is it lacking only by the staff or at the logical jurisdiction ?
&quot; there were , however , the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
this is why a consistent education of such events and hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist is of crucial importance .
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and convenient food . &quot;
&quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ eled means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect all relevant authorities , that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps . &quot;
how the Fis@@ cal Reg@@ ulations of Football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come from the UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar sub@@ mits and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to use legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had taken huge debts in their quest for success , effectively g@@ rie@@ ve and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P closing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to frigh@@ ten away from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P at UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , who could attempt to over@@ ride their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come up with payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup ambass@@ adors will be released , and such a maneu@@ ver could be easily identified for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to consider any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country owns a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is at a possible conclusion : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white wrapped chocolate panels are distributed to 14 grams per year , before landing on passengers . &quot;
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order in the &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss do not want to betra@@ y how many applicants are in the new bid .
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers are involved in this issue . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y plans to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss chocolate panels are spread on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline collabor@@ ates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are pam@@ pered by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter shot the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to greater things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . &quot;
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is running out .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by shifting to the core of the g@@ ags of the middle age - actors of middle @-@ age play cool kids , who are grown up - still creating the im@@ possibility to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults , who now play adult , is less emotional u@@ pro@@ oted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that catches the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character kno@@ cks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
there is another crazy nasty plot in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random ins@@ anity that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I call his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , athei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ al@@ istic is@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( another producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to see ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent match &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who we@@ ars a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single agan .
&quot; with six long episodes , it &apos;s gone , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ mitted to a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian writers were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart visited numerous objects such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years ago and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros were safe . &quot;
two people were arrested in Italy during the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German area . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nation@@ als with close ties to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way lo@@ oms large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner grid
&quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the Ali@@ ens Central Register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to data , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the Register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in isolated cases data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can dras@@ tically slow down revers@@ als , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such false statements , however , &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; means in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this is what emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF is conducting such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant goes to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) reserves these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left hand fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children threaten the un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded Friday .
&quot; above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his now 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the community acknow@@ le@@ dges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant how our body is laid out for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors , who provide their blood for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; underlined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single donation of blood helps several people , &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preserves are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K county leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a converted to the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and forecast for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue , while inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ aled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be needed to brid@@ le the inflation , and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package that was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of an increase in net interest rate , and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low wage increases , as the tigh@@ tening process is even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; &quot; in the next few years , but she added that wages at the end of her three @-@ year forecast can &quot; &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the interest . &quot;
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
&quot; before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase in 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that exceeding 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent decline of the Swa@@ p R@@ ats , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive , as len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is said to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ formative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis received before the sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year &apos;s ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) designated this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious agents .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for a possible participation at their local sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is specifically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted towards needy and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we hear@@ tily welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ atively this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the cess@@ ation of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank manager with a passion for real estate , reduced itself to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other , without having to bend us . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it look longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is vit@@ ally important , so when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electric sockets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn into something amazing by a good design and increased square meter of something standard .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property empire
&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the largest real estate @-@ imperialist Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s fortune and Paul about a third . &quot;
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a point of trouble for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affair in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for the control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both sides . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; you used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ep of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark , Paul &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts is .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s claims . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
the new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including reports from the news media - hoping to hold the boss on an even more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s White House which he wanted to repair : poor information that ran into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said to the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame the mp by monitoring its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television reaches many decades back - and now , where he is at the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if tur@@ mp was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February facing Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp Twitter &quot; &quot; habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tru@@ mp twe@@ ets would have even more fuel in their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to keep anger from him , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp Materials that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - busy with this story , reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to indu@@ ce doubt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on how they came from . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the trust . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most Wan@@ ted criminals get Post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe will send postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after s@@ words are not known in nature , information from the population is hoped and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows on the &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; advent calendar in winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many cur@@ ses were hiding on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 Post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online cas@@ u@@ alties could be arrested so far , at least 11 of them due to evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some determined travellers on the base of war , which have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the congregation in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous owner said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday night after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place , if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot;
&quot; a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to make it move as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof forest hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente corporation company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the administrative office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up an extension plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council . &quot;
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it to a house of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building shell containers in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , ceilings are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s noti@@ ons were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define precisely . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he counts . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in an inner courtyard , there is a large terrace accessible from the restaurant that is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Agent wins Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the panel received the work and wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to people familiar with it . &quot;
the newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there were already first dischar@@ ges of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the investigation , several men are supposed to stand who acted as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller included more and more tru@@ mp private and business environment under the microscope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tru@@ mp had personally moved into the center and investigated whether the president could potentially obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of the Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges should be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand jur@@ ys are also known to be prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel may also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to interro@@ gate under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N broad@@ caster , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement that was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
&quot; apart from Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the objection showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; however , the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new cause for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the subject gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about .
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
&quot; however , they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerate the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this gul@@ f , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been according to alle@@ gations that he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June , before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp requested him to set up the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and his collabor@@ ators . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp would release Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent ambassador of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators proposed legislation on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold ber@@ lin of Berlin has solved itself from the Sch@@ el@@ zeb@@ s . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the giant col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now dri@@ es to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for human beings .
&quot; according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ eber@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken Kol@@ oss was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us so far .
Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaciers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ ony is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance between wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt a few years ago .
&quot; A@@ WI researcher , Daniela Jan@@ sen , writes a complete scrap file . &quot;
&quot; some of them say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key place . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it emerges after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the shelf makes it possible that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , albeit only in a small measure , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth biggest shot of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists it is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ zeb@@ s will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly come together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these scientists do not lead the abor@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg not to climate change , in recent decades many ice mis@@ hes of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature rose .
&quot; in the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees and en@@ um@@ er@@ ates to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to withdraw from the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the day of the circle started 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
&quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot;
the teaching positions in circles are apparently very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were listed for the places to be missed this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 dig@@ its in the M@@ ett@@ mann group . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the search for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U would like to join the F@@ DP together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs at skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented job short@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , show specific measures for cross @-@ entry and involve a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good start .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or age . &quot;
&quot; so high time for action , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he took care of a big surprise already in the circle of the district , when he publicly challenged the staff@@ ing cost and the other parties were astonished . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be examined , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; when NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with fellow merchants in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself in detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew will take @-@ boat migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer who supervised their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and attractions . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , the lookout point came to the lookout point , connected to the &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many meters of altitude have been announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcomed breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at@@ m@@ eten a cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Forest from its best side - athle@@ tic and cultural . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga wel@@ ds for e @-@ sport
&quot; in the future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ at@@ y in wind and weather over stadium racing ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ unt@@ lets . &quot;
they have also recognized the first federal registry agreements that are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that there are still many clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend the FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main and PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football , in particular , has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga @-@ author@@ ship to Asia . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or Football @-@ Simulation FIFA will be cont@@ ested at the competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a proper sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid re@@ activity . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console , but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the bad player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult for online games and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey . &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already on .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ erer Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are in the meantime required to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to stick to it , that only football remains as it was always . &quot;
ven@@ om eggs - Eg@@ g alternatives for cooking and baking
&quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal surrounding toxic eggs . &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have responded and taken all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany .
&quot; in regi@@ ments only eggs should be taken , which demon@@ stra@@ bly contain no fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot;
Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy pus@@ hes for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t charge the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in one vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed word messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; all you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention through the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern stun@@ ned the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation didn &apos;t hurt there .
&quot; anything else was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua made Kim@@ me right away , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the console could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs. the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also point to me .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday . &quot;
&quot; sugar@@ s are best distributed to those , to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in mind . &quot;
&quot; therefore , whoever was chosen to commen@@ ce the legacy of L@@ ame can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
&quot; right back , this is his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ mich took part in this starting formation , like the one who can best take the helm . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had a look at the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( did not fold ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , to get out of the services of the Asia trip ( fold only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran along Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli assault was often difficult , and Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game setup . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance during the debut .
&quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new arri@@ vals , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said goodbye to his new players after a few crisp statements .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have noticed now . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you simply have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V requests from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old ministers .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the top priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is supposed to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west border of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal transport network . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ du Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it as a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) Trier aims , as is suggested by Wis@@ sing , in wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed Master Ex@@ am@@ ination and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ betrieb Mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce also calls for more jobs to be assigned to external offices .
&quot; s &amp; D Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of regional roads than suggested . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank Nat@@ us still anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wishes to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country was further sober@@ ing .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with grade 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; former Economy Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she cleared the field after four months because of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
&quot; one day before Audi announced that it would be offered to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens , and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles also increase , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ver@@ tig@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but driving back to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were charged ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the involvement of Audi into the investigation could weigh Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft goes through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; after passing the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between the F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building department wants to clear up .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a large information otran@@ sm@@ itter . &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protective game of game . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los crack @-@ n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as an artist for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artists of cities let themselves be inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own statements , he still sits at the drawing table , works every day almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his funny figures continue to find a lot of dis@@ semination worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters . &quot;
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures are in the 3D movie to come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to the diseases transmitted insects which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions are causing great head@@ aches .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , and in the autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the Sin@@ alo@@ a state through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the forefront of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and feelings are sufficient . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we are suspi@@ cious of all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla had been stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ stor@@ eyed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute , that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , there was an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ita Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , assumed power members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , not to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper comp@@ eted a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it went . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ tail like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and thereby remain alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways , &quot; in order to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong@@ ly , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space in which the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two police officers were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a central @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor described himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it has been months since the re@@ porters passed into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated in the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local for drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political planes almost the whole century . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage of signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press , &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and om@@ it them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked for her to be re@@ organized by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a society of equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media @-@ W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ um 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of their Director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trafficking was terri@@ fying him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ ckle . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the border , they have published news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are close by - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of closing , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain labor@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown , and they said she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the dark@@ ly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has ast@@ ound researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa , the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably has been threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ act , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and do@@ dge its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by enough pressure by flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ aded - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous age , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal regarding his life , including his preserved colon to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea bed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative sc@@ aly skin but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time , as giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ glut@@ ton was s@@ war@@ med by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ bel@@ s still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
&quot; the remains of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which bear the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , miles long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured at a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late th@@ urs@@ day afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information of the police , between 17@@ .00 hrs , between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into one another . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no indication of the exact number of the last complaints . &quot;
&quot; it was mild to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman . &quot;
a large amount of b@@ ail@@ out on rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a return route was about ten kilometres long . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z journalist reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ated the license plates of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : exhaust .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes up an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run is running on two lines . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available on many other distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without any conductor .
&quot; to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
&quot; you must also have purchased the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
&quot; and last but not least , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls on his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , then a button on the electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train attend@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; the train attend@@ ant arrives at the ticket control at No@@ .@@ Y , he knows there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attend@@ ant , simply check out in the DB Navig@@ ator themselves . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their journey in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed features , ticket inspections are among the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show will be missing .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , which leads to poor sen@@ timent in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; new Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ arded on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . , live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , with a polic@@ eman standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman and cried , &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l recalled her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ uson is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists in the view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ uson , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we go to F@@ erg@@ uson right now because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be educated in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service , to keep her away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place facing the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the potential non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came about Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around to@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other local people the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; followed in the years following Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who talks to us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ &apos;s experience - to show that in the movement &quot; not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life , as she falls in love with her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin played the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy &quot; she said .
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the intelligence eras in F@@ erg@@ uson have disappeared long ago , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;

from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they have not been built for a long time .
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation of 2009 , split the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters insist that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed out . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been shopping for many years in the farmers market hall for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , too . &quot;
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping center in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a pity , there are almost no longer special stores and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the market hall meet during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes at some point . &quot;
or does the spec@@ tra@@ st bit Gallery already manage to exp@@ el all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; there are many faces to see in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly classified diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called a Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment , not only for the for@@ war@@ dness of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already talked openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison had supp@@ ressed her image , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly uncomfortable sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ n@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ eff@@ ers that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ lement Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chel@@ ating would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome way of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tru@@ mp is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written by a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in terms of biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in the hands of a hands @-@ free speech in the United States of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they let your speech be cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greetings from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it , she will be greeted by the masks from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; it was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at Oxford University because of killing
a nation @-@ wide hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who were considered susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a joint warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the dead body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been over@@ rated and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to surrender .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timetable , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s timetable to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ installing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of dop@@ ing approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ti &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov reported problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody proposed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing checks in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing scandal by the WA@@ DA . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs for the moment
this divided the company groups .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could no longer be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the release . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ ged anti @-@ lice . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Al@@ di wants to make clear and transparent with his customers . &quot;
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and chief executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
she said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ veys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company looking at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - allowing you to drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance , where those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Conver@@ cent enables companies to send customized &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ tible sets out , problems identified by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster than discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take on ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations of the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both startups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their workplaces than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only wag@@ ering . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that heard their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , there may be an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments can be brid@@ ged and employees de@@ motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you &apos;ll have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees will ask , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T so that salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to better bonding of workers in a sector known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not required to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already completed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six playing times in West@@ wood conducted practical exercises . &quot;
they are expected to perform 18 exercises during August . 20 prior to the formal season preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they cl@@ ack on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the Camp is completed , which is not an easy task , given the clear sight of its fields , adjacent parking spaces and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective net behind a door@@ post . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third @-@ party fak@@ ers and then view their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may display results of the fact review from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters are flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan after which social media networks are to be punished if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate explanation in German that a test of the new facts inspection was launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are cont@@ ested by fak@@ ers third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ iry Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , British May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led for the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , I have a little over@@ rated &quot; &quot; ) that seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ da arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to appear on a broader base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portrayed in the 18th century using a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , getting debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ lords .
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ oped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz will keep the logo and slogan hidden . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them on their website that was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , she is competing with other commun@@ es . &quot;
the city of Bad Honne@@ f &apos;s new umbrella brand and the campaign cost a mean five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the general staff , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of state , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , civilians were in the hands of Y@@ AS . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a re@@ porter of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , is negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan declared the attempt to overthrow the armed forces , as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really has the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; un@@ ease in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the suspension of the ban on soldiers for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale train in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan issued a further 73@@ 95 coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at by decree , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they listened to their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan dri@@ v@@ eth pur@@ pos@@ efully an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt against persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance , after the cleansing , there is doubt in the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it envis@@ ages to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by changing the way citizens are issued from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate distance for rac@@ et@@ rack shuttle
&quot; in the past few months , over the past few months has been cont@@ ested over the future of the rac@@ et@@ rack - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , there is to be built on the seaside route , on which the tourist railways drive . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing cable long @-@ term , there will be construction work on the route according to the Ministry of Transport in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country acknow@@ le@@ dges this especially for tourism , &quot; explained Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , will be finally approved , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a duration of eleven years .
&quot; in doing so , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in recent months , a pilot plant has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the route is strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of the sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the allu@@ sions to rape , if one approaches a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah is disturbing one the most . &quot;
on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is le@@ aking out of the edge areas , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the printed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical likeness to real women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the language of speech by 2017 : ma@@ ids
tru@@ mp great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp @-@ era of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have polar@@ ised the US constitu@@ ency , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp relatives . &quot;
we all re@@ port@@ edly urge all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite independently on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it seems to me that this also involves considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the strength to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Urugu@@ ay@@ an version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both of which are in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp is concerned , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ el of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the city &apos;s reality will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ ed Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a stran@@ gely magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can walk on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only result in a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first murder .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too pru@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it would raise objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
finding a strange egg as a farmer Arnold
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four@@ ths of the flock and the E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were sent to the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in future , three of the discharge students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , under the leadership of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grew up in the chickens &apos; farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chickens erhof &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and had it hat@@ ched from his chickens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study by Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; said trainer An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonging to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every quarter of the four@@ teenth to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; there followed acceptance speech to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps into the classroom and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;
&quot; the chi@@ cks time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only divor@@ ced her students , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they can rely on the four @-@ leg@@ ged sy@@ ll@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight original players have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported on B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel @-@ drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emission behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ace car Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no . the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet mentioned a precise date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to each affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework of the inspection . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do that drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace advises to wait .
&quot; foreign manufacturers would probably consult , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE feared that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ace advises to wait for sale .

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that so far no application has been able to fulfill the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer for the next possible time .
&quot; in this way , under consideration of the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Authority , the applicant must demonstrate corresponding degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood among the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area for example have been initiated .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium san@@ itation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be@@ ech at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city @-@ builder with great scope .
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and nursery , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphasizes the reti@@ ring city builder . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the mayor is responsible for a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going through my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and left with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who would like to be heir to Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree course as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of building planning and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt subordin@@ ates construction and civil engineering , construction guidelines , bur@@ r @-@ wer@@ age facilities , administration of urban properties , urban de@@ pot with building yard and urban gardens as well as the Lower Building Authority , including historic monuments protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : southern track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track over the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
close to the scene there were witnessed by witnesses a ro@@ sy sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a wealth of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB Spo@@ kes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have brought himself into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail sales , P@@ ön@@ alen railway customers could also get to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum was to go out , said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south run@@ way could be managed without any disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten passenger trains dropped out on Friday morning , two of them were viewing the distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; dairy meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition affecting around 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the US causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the lead researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells which are capable of trig@@ gering inflamm@@ ations are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han will promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus if the same system is working with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doc@@ torate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been separately accommodated . &quot;
&quot; they assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial chromos@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells , but without missing them in mice . &quot;
mice were re@@ ared in a sterile environment so that they did not have an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the scientists left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the fluid it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same intoler@@ ance @-@ promoting cells like mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can potentially lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off on Tuesday , and impressed in the bracket role , as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the for@@ warding Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew away from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such an advertisement in the past .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new heart@@ beat for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind revers@@ ed : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ demo@@ crat prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only there was no fire in the party centre , but no opposition from the League - that was the most important wish of the elec@@ tive fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have watched the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a counter @-@ wind .
there were failures .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can not be governed reliably , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , editor of the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens MEP , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the election of the country , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony depu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ails to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ails must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Finance and Elec@@ toral Committee of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) editorial network . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true at all , &quot; an SPD leader si@@ gh@@ ed , when on Friday morning the new message of Job was reached by the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ails to the CD@@ U without own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , not more , the comrades cal@@ med down . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and all things became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the do@@ cking , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cleared the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; te@@ dious , comrades in the weeks after that , resum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he did pretty much everything wrong , which you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ ab@@ at@@ ement and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been critic@@ ised for some time now . &quot;
ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe this is why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l increasingly tried to set accents in the Bund . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment . &quot;
&quot; they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l . &quot;
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the non @-@ party co@@ er@@ cion of the &quot; &quot; Lower Saxony &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ens , basically , no fault . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all at all .
&quot; for the time being , comrades , therefore , try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism T@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ ails puts her own career prospects on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ails has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has been elected to Parliament by the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , thus further down to the Lower Saxony depu@@ ties . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er consent four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony Democratic Party to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U depu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments made by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding funds for local centre III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development were informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been a lot of rehabilitation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refurb@@ ishment projects are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is also important to promote inner development , and not only to develop new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Vice @-@ President of Karlsruhe that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum of funds amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the municipality feeling . &quot;
what is the result of a remedi@@ ation area ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area is interested in rehabil@@ itating . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area borders may be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , that is , per property . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the association may take place as soon as possible , so that the san@@ itation can begin next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that every municipality has to carry out the said Vor@@ ab investigations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide the urban development gri@@ ev@@ ances when it is rehabil@@ itated and in what extent .
there will also be a restructuring mem@@ orandum in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to his own feelings and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; in which , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the renovation prospects . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; , &quot; information about the size , division and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; arc &quot; can only be filled out if operating rooms are operated in the building .
&quot; however , it must be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first grin@@ ds first .
you cannot reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor finds himself a micro@@ chip in order to come into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ tist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one now has installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military specifications left to TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military bure@@ au of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 am on the South La@@ wn for the event , until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security guards stayed on the plane during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it did not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could violate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was referred to as official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the reform of health , which was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for political reasons , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation , when the presidential aircraft performed before the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to de@@ compose the US President at the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was in Germany at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the crew crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for the presidential flight , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things produced in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for whom so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
&quot; at the top of the second tennis league , Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V is the leader of the second tennis league . &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will appear tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; in spite of five games , which is still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Federation has maintained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north provide above all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes difficult for us as always . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good dose of luck , too . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp wasn &apos;t really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress submitted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and Brussels also sh@@ amed the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed with the construction of the Russian east@@ ward expansion of North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ one is huge .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken even the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; has looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos relay 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the Hit@@ row from Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not yet passed . &quot;
&quot; the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) , is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña who invites the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
role for@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city again organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ches itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban day@@ care centers .
&quot; on September 1 , Kre@@ feld will once again take over the food supply in the city &apos;s kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant leader in the youth aid department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooking is kept out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh , cooked . &quot;
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ ten year , 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 days in the week , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al @-@ time employees from 1 September have kitchen service : they warm up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group and seven @-@ group facilities - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because it is also about eating healthy eating and cooking lessons .
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is worthwhile .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , which it has proved to be the most economical in comparison to the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign publishing for the city as the most economical . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are set anew . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eled in the provincial elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible when women fully participate and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban released threats against a choice process which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat action to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ on said that a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 pm , because they wanted to talk to the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however was mis@@ leading . &quot;
&quot; without prey , the duo fled . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to wi@@ den the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in Man@@ agers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch leader , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie told us to &quot; express concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot;
&quot; said G@@ MB @-@ senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the director of T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies active in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may appeal to her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be ref@@ unded in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced his way out , although there is a spring near the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but has the football world been warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G President from this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign with them , then this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association put an interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price quot@@ ations for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;
disc@@ arded and damaged roller
&quot; in the night from Friday to Saturday an unknown perpetr@@ ator intentionally raised a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property number 30 , and thus caused damage to more than 200 Euros in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car met him in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW van and tou@@ red the console . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
&quot; in the area of the survey of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to escape to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console . &quot;
on the passenger car did not hurt .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damage , it can be good that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the caus@@ al experience to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann refers to this .
the final report about the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then incorrect assessment of the events . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; two measures &quot; were measured . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was about &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking was the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also spoke to the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Service in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you would like to go to the church and this is a bon@@ ded fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; blows have been a very normal educational tool , &quot; &quot; to cope with bold children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; Mein brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer Ulrich Weber asked by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , despite violence , they even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz did not have a top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all found in it . &quot;
&quot; just eight pages are dedicated to him , and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; the princip@@ alities at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , too , took place outside of his sphere of influence . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to repro@@ ach him at best , find out of it too late or not take the first hint seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ lash @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by almost all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his disciples , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also described a very excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood erup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted for years , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the use of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him . &quot;
&quot; many people , who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e , still work di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity regarding sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said one person who was affected , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the true problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator in a certain way . &quot;
what is the rating of the R@@ atz@@ inger family @-@ cats in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a du@@ bi@@ ous student expressed it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is credited to him ... hei@@ rs in intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused of having prevented or brought it to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violent texts &quot; &quot; were read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge m@@ é@@ lange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but precisely this is again an abuse of the report .
&quot; it is clearly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the secondary school of the &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; , &quot; between sexual abuse and violence and , let &apos;s say , other alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; the report also covers incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were ou@@ tra@@ ged and subjected to horri@@ fic suffering , were all acquired at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ ore gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most of the witnesses stressed , the subject &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ lash @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was indeed discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , despite violence , combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he was just beginning to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently left the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even re@@ producing . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ishments were banned long ago in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took advantage of a legal grey area , like everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate the extent that the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit was really exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the prison term for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time of that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians say &quot; &quot; fall @-@ kn@@ it of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then practice . &quot;
this is all horrible and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working up .
but at the same time I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. sla@@ ying ears and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his rain@@ bow time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger have shown in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of testing also available for speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI says from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not refuse to lead a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone one makes no big singers and before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talking to her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I really got to know George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep @-@ believing and sincere people , of whom one could not imagine that he could only do something to a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still stay in contact with him today , 23 years after his accreditation , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgiven him until now , that he once was strict with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to which they still look up today and admir@@ ing them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly : all that one repro@@ aches him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , is reli@@ eved of it . &quot;
&quot; now the con@@ tention would lie , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
