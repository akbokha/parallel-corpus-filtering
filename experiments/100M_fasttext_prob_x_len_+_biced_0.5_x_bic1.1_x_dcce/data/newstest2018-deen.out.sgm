<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish prison where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich fosters exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-navigation system was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork rug which is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called original compositions, were incorporated into cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian surveying business, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the early 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops moved away with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographical Bureau, "and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The foundation sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison Fruher / Today, for example, is the most impressive example of the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, in the district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flutes from the so-called" "primeval" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no longer farmers there - but farmers of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "am Gasteig" "or from the" "Auf der Lüfte" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt" "in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Lüfte" "was born."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - a psychiatrist, who was brought to death by King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use force against occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients first place was first place, later extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity did not suffice any more - the reason for the construction of the circular mill in the hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now meeting on the grounds of the former Auer Institute.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" main square "in 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, Small Business Houses and a Gruftchapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn (S-Bahn) race track will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Union for Supporting Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people, who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discriminatory lawsuits, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star, said, because of their skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney Office, which is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be prepared to bring a deposit or know the relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidefence Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The German parliament members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishing association CDU met together with mayors Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest "milk" is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, "says Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste there is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "essential." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green land area cares for much work, much must be edited with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental plant and used it without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the expense of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their operation," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the maintenance area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted via leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"consequently, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac emphasised:" "you do a really good job without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiss was certain: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Line Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides state-of-the-art funding for pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the fenced area may not be tractor-deductible (slope of 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing tackle project 2018, there is currently an application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have lied to him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed the meaning and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, your afflicted masses, who longs to breathe freely, the miserable rubbish of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when "miserable garbage" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">He did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great shouting Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer, but rather an early neo-conservative, which brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not meant to enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch will not lighten the path, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "Scotland is something special" "and the UK's athletics have to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there's something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think there's something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is fairly modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "extremely proud" "in the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and at the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers have voted for me and have chosen me makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate electing voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he complained in the criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, sued him at the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum designated as officially designated and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whips online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governors of the Governor designated as a" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably name others" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or being deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest protesters and silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters knocked on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Navigation with Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are part of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>

<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovis campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers to foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshal Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the allegations of the group and said:" in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights. "</seg>

<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jokovi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokovi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," "says Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants the Paniai people to know that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobi says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokovi as a" "debt" "which he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai casualties led a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a plot close to the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they might never come to justice, but at least they do not forget their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is about a deadline, which expired on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground-down ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with one year, to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecuted by President Donald Trump prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or delaying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal backlash for the Pruster regulatory rolling back agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing methane leakage."</seg>

<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA often has not adhered to the deadlines for implementing and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the date for carrying out," said Prupp, who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the 6th Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters Tumlingens to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documentary documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the certificate of the certificate, on the Tumlingen hill, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard belonging to which the Church or the patron law belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the" mountain "is the third, the most beautiful settling nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">"ancient maps dating back to 1600, underpin these historical circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in this connection, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows and the bell were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlingen Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and the half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower of Turmzwerg remained as a witness of the 750 year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to allow approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim refuses" "sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the land council."</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim resists" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheim Nette, no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there was a wind power concentration zone."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones will prevent the landscape from being spared.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a lack of form."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval is still illegal and therefore rejected," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" at this point, the issuance of a licence for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out legally. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the call.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been in the circle of Viersen since last week," "explained a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion of reviewing the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself with regard to the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare estate."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the power requirement of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg region.</seg>

<seg id="573">"before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block its way."</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip procession - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="575">Inside the occupants were in fear.</seg>

<seg id="583">"it is really inconceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches, although we know who they are," "said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of postures."</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was ever accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain free on foot for decades, citizens' rights advocate that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer election campaign."</seg>

<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="598">"but when they came from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car."</seg>
<seg id="599">"as it turns out, it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report. "</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, evicted evidence and has disguised the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks makes it even more concise.</seg>

<seg id="606">"it's hard to watch, and hard to see, but Greene said that is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynx, because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened to a well-rehearsed overview of the piece."</seg>

<seg id="611">"he has played the role of the boss-clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier."</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," "said Marbaugh."</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it is very important to get this story alive, because we do not want to return to these times."</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."</seg>

<seg id="617">Rascona reciprocates the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>

<seg id="629">"everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and with imprint."</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>

<seg id="640">"they have experienced Georgias oppressive hydration every eight hours, when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys."</seg>
<seg id="641">"until this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body's bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children sitting on their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet body and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," "mumbles a little boy, as if he wanted to remember."</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>

<seg id="709">"amount: well clear, here it's not about calculating the static charges."</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people who have a different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">"whether a refugee, whether a teenager, who has been squeezed out of the family - you have to deal with it individually."</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>

<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the municipal council are hovering that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorous living, but openly enter into the church."</seg>

<seg id="762">It's not that easy in the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one can't move so well, but now you lean on the common room out of the window, she says:" "I'm not doing it hard with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to any anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsidy, but receives a real, in case of doubt a marketable counter-value, is the counter-speech."</seg>

<seg id="861">Andre Hoffmann is hoping after 2: 2 for the season opener against Braunschweig for optimising the defensive formation in Aue points.</seg>
<seg id="862">"Andre Hoffmann was happy with the first match of the season, with the result that the two opponents were not at 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-chain chain is to be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a gate after a breach, the Fortuners also don't want to catch up anymore."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no one else besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three-chain-chain after the experience in preparation with the four-chain chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we are in the three-chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we don't make so many mistakes in the structure."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk after a draw from a failed start, don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could be quite okay," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer wanted nothing to know about that.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I judged the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," Friedhelm Funky, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Radiel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might be even a bit fresher, since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know exactly where they are now," says the inner defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday enter the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," "says funk, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue out of nine games."</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">Recent findings from testing for asylum seekers in Sweden undergoing a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began performing the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration Verket) has been criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage."</seg>
<seg id="887">"up to now, migration verket 6,880 has been sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said to the journal The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the requested person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, where x-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were going earlier or later than usual by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used."</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we cannot say it safe, we should not pretend as if we could," "he said to the newspaper metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect. "</seg>
<seg id="902">"the greatest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="915">They are made of red sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">"both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long."</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach left on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">"this is a border attachment, which is also used as operating mode."</seg>
<seg id="919">"on the southern part of the bridge, a 2,20 meter wide bridge can be used on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should go.</seg>
<seg id="921">"the special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo."</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular finger-tip-feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar submits and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power-rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to use legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"former French player believed that clubs, who had taken huge debts in their quest for success, effectively grieve and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of FFP closing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten away from excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>

<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs, who could attempt to override their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsor's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come up with payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"but PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be released, and such a maneuver could be easily identified for the UEFA regulators."</seg>

<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>

<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is at a possible conclusion: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northern Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman. "</seg>
<seg id="1165">"around 17 million small red-white wrapped chocolate panels are distributed to 14 grams per year, before landing on passengers."</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"industry insiders estimate the volume of order in the" "Northwest Switzerland" "to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss do not want to betray how many applicants are in the new bid.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"however, only Swiss manufacturers are involved in this issue."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey plans to renew the contract over the spring of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eighties, for the 90-year-Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to greater things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for an speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by shifting to the core of the gags of the middle age - actors of middle-age play cool kids, who are grown up - still creating the impossibility to win back the last part of the Witzes."</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with its adults, who now play adult, is less emotional uprooted and his parody goes more to the watering can principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90's years such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that catches the cradle"). "</seg>
<seg id="1190">"at one point, a character knocks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" a number of other things from 1991. "</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">There is another crazy nasty plot in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-known impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the exams are the best part of franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's Unterlippenbart of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now like an old boy."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it is the moments of random insanity that could heat this franchise as a sort of repetitive" Seven Up! "series, until he reaches what I call his logical conclusion:" wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, "whose last scene will show the gang of" Wet Hot American Summer. ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography. "</seg>
<seg id="1199">"the comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism."</seg>

<seg id="1204">"and the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent match 'Finde the voice'."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single agan.</seg>
<seg id="1206">"with six long episodes, it's gone, and the comedy is not fast or often enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was remitted to a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef constantly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1214">"in addition, large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros were safe."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested in Italy during the same raids in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, more than 300 policemen were in use."</seg>

<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"therefore, the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.</seg>

<seg id="1236">"in the statistics on sufficient people, EU citizens are also included who would not have to leave."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false statements, however," led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient "means in the analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they arrived from there."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members striving to increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and forecast for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue, while inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to just under 3%."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signaled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be needed to bridle the inflation, and she said that the borrowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package that was published one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it is said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after the decision on interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates it repeated that" "a certain tightening of monetary policy" "would be required to cool inflation and a" "greater" "scale than the markets would expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that elevations would be" progressively "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations of an increase in net interest rate, and GDP increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the tightening process is even worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot" "prevent income" "in the next few years, but she added that wages at the end of her three-year forecast can" "recuperate". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the interest."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank appreciates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call for interest rate increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase in 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that exceeding 2% was "entirely" attributable to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" given the recent decline of the Swap Rats, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive, as lenders are loudly looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) is said to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people"</seg>
<seg id="1291">"from September onwards, patients will receive access to a" transformative "HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylaxis received before the sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by healthcare via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year's ruling by the Supreme Court, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance him."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS leader Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) designated this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious agents.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics will identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt-in for a possible participation at their local sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as it is specifically used, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted towards needy and vulnerable people, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We heartily welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority now must be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformatively this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the cessation of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bank manager with a passion for real estate, reduced itself to a Earls Court apartment in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlap, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," "he explains."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other, without having to bend us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulin lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is vitally important, so when you push the door, it is very easy to glide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor space, and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "you do not love the electric sockets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can turn into something amazing by a good design and increased square meter of something standard.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family in 1973 bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's fortune and Paul about a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a point of trouble for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "he wrote in a first affair in 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now fight for the control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">"you used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, where Colin opened the first jeep of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons."</seg>

<seg id="1382">Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I can really not say much" because the case before the courts is.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," "he wrote."</seg>

<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including reports from the news media - hoping to hold the boss on an even more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House which he wanted to repair: poor information that ran into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame the mp by monitoring its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television reaches many decades back - and now, where he is at the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if turmp was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February facing Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keeping Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that" "Trump Twitter" "habit was ever" under control, "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump tweets would have even more fuel in their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times to keep anger from him, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Materials that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - busy with this story, reported in May about the preference of the advisers to induce doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on how they came from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and document the trust."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof forest hotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente corporation company ltd. on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the administrative office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up an extension plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in Berlin at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it to a house of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shell containers in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were pulled out, ceilings are partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "pretty bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already on a high-level downtown level, Scherer stresses."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's notions were identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"under one million euros, he counts."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in an inner courtyard, there is a large terrace accessible from the restaurant that is open to public."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: us Special Agent wins Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special Agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the panel received the work and wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal to people familiar with it."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there were already first discharges of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trump oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the Trump election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the investigation, several men are supposed to stand who acted as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller included more and more trump private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump had personally moved into the center and investigated whether the president could potentially obstruct the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of the Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand jurys are also known to be prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel may also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN broadcaster, charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement that was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"apart from Trump Jr. were also Trump consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his team leader Paul Manafort in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the objection showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an accusation."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new cause for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the democrats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the substitution of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"however, they usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures that accelerate the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this gulf, accusations against Trump have been according to allegations that he wants to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June, before a Senate committee, Trump requested him to set up the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and his collaborators."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump would release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent ambassador of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired president, Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators proposed legislation on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg is driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold berlin of Berlin has solved itself from the Schelzebs."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the giant colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, now dries to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the icebergs."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhagus swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagony is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance between waxes and abrupt a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"AWI researcher, Daniela Jansen, writes a complete scrap file."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some of them say that the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key place."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it emerges after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shelf makes it possible that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, albeit only in a small measure, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth biggest shot of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelzebs will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly come together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these scientists do not lead the abortion of this gigantic iceberg not to climate change, in recent decades many ice mishes of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature rose.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees and enumerates to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to withdraw from the Employers' Association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the day of the circle started 41 new jobs in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">"more than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann."</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have left their first working day."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in circles are apparently very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were listed for the places to be missed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 digits in the Mettmann group."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, the search for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">"the CDU would like to join the FDP together with the FDP and the UWG, and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration will develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term needs at skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented job shortages."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate internally and externally, show specific measures for cross-entry and involve a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good start.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a real "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"so high time for action, so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter races, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he took care of a big surprise already in the circle of the district, when he publicly challenged the staffing cost and the other parties were astonished."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be examined, which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-related cities - a house tariff," "says Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightened the tone on NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue unless they adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"when NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Minister of Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team had worked effectively with fellow merchants in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can judge all accusations currently being collected, after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that his crew will take-boat migrants aboard, which can be delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer who supervised their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin Outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and attractions."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation at the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">Burgundy and Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, the lookout point came to the lookout point, connected to the" flowerge "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many meters of altitude have been announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcomed breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers atmeten a curative brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga welds for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in the future, the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being sweaty in wind and weather over stadium racing?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-Sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauntlets."</seg>
<seg id="1615">They have also recognized the first federal registry agreements that are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "that there are still many clubs on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend the FIFA World Cup organized the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in London, where gamers compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football, in particular, has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundesliga-authorship to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or Football-Simulation FIFA will be contested at the competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Ligen has long established itself, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"e-sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactivity."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the bad player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobber also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult for online games and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly about advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey. ""</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already on.</seg>

<seg id="1648">Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Wetterer Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot happening in Europe as well.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobber."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football league clubs, according to Dutt, are in the meantime required to set up an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to decay in nostalgia, and to clear the old times, is no longer enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time align the company with the modern market."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was convicted in June for the negligent murder of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown repentance." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance that they completely regret."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" "no day in which I don't charge the loss of my beloved Son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain, which we will carry for eternity with us, for his sisters." "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in one vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carter revealed word messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" all you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told Carter's attention through the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"MS Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the Sinaloa state through organised crime, corrupt civil servants and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the forefront of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and feelings are sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and while the bodies pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama ut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we are suspicious of all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla had been stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "Twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute, that there is a state of" tranquility "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, there was an interview with Damascita Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, assumed power members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003 he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper competed a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for her reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it went."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curtail like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Is his love for routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best, and thereby remain alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways," in order to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrongly, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space in which the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two police officers were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a central-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor described himself as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters passed into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated in the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local for drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political planes almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the most informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage of signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press, "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and omit them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked for her to be reorganized by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a society of equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media-Wächtergruppe" Articulum 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to hold your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admitted that drug trafficking was terrifying him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to buckle."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with Bandenrivals and security forces near the Mazatlan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the border, they have published news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are close by - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think of closing," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain laborer have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown, and they said she had something of a" troubled past. ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described him as" the darkly armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well-preserved condition has astound researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa, the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably has been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counteract, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure by flesh-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shaded - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was subjected to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the Cretaceous age," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal regarding his life, including his preserved colon to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and driven into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea bed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative scaly skin but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time, as giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-glutton was swarmed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater coverage of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Haubels still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rare as a gain in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"the remains of the skin cover still the bumpy armoured plates, which bear the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: mass Karambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, miles long staus - and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured at a mass karambolage on the late thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first information of the police, between 17.00 hrs, between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed into one another."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there is no indication of the exact number of the last complaints."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large amount of bailout on rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of Munich, a return route was about ten kilometres long."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as an AZ journalist reports, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive obstructions - by numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire brigade notated the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and wakes up an unsuspecting or pulls the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run is running on two lines."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available on many other distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the train ticket devaluation without any conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you must also have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">"and last but not least, you need a seat reservation."</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: one climbs into the train, calls on his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, then a button on the electronic devaluation will appear."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"the train attendant arrives at the ticket control at No.Y, he knows there is a passenger with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, simply check out in the DB Navigator themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their journey in the train more personal," "says Michael Peterson, Head of Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr."</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed features, ticket inspections are among the biggest nuances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times, however, one of the contributors does not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show will be missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to poor sentiment in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of testers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retarded on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She dropped her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets on people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Browns father who wore a shield with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, secured another policeman and cried," I'm going to kill you... animals all kill you. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists in the view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" over the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We go to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take her with me," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service, to keep her away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the potential non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came about Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around todestract inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other local people the team of" Whose Streets "followed in the years following Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who talks to us or speaks to us. we talk," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferr's experience - to show that in the movement" not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr's life, as she falls in love with her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferr's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin played the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "at which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">She was the person who shook this energy "she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crossings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the intelligence eras in Ferguson have disappeared long ago, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">She is still clinging to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they have not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation of 2009, split the population into proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" That's a real class "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters insist that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping for many years in the farmers market hall for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping center in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it's a pity, there are almost no longer special stores and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the market hall meet during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the spectrast bit Gallery already manage to expel all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "it just won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmers market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">Matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"there are many faces to see in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being publicly classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called a Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, not only for the forwardness of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already talked openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison had suppressed her image, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarnated muse became unequal brieffers that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Supplement Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President of Chelating would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things are going to happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature among them (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written by a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 characters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazing, at least in terms of biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of a hands-free speech in the United States of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they let your speech be cold, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greetings from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it, she will be greeted by the masks from her own genomic simulations, together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nation-wide hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who were considered suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the dead body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigating the stitches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been overrated and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in every conceivable way.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to surrender.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of doping approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programs, and we will not give anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutti's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov reported problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.

<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of nuisance, where those who have spoken are punished."</seg>

<seg id="2221">"it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the public opinion condemns the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>

<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company Convertible sets out, problems identified by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster than discrimination, harassment or unfair practice."</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already completed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras, six playing times in Westwood conducted practical exercises."</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are expected to perform 18 exercises during August. 20 prior to the formal season preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Mora said he supported the control change of the NCAA even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophairy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says melancholy. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, British May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter, which was written by a double-agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell to smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled for the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle (" "To be honest, I have a little overrated" ") that seems to be all too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" "new" "castle, to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey and began to write. ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhoda arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to appear on a broader base in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' which tells the story of the Jesuit paters who hid the family Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed in the 18th century using a coffin filled with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, getting debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys with a talent to advertise landlords.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique write experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki behind him, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a reporter of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, is negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the day after the coup, Erdogan declared the attempt to overthrow the armed forces, as he gave him the opportunity to completely cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But Erdogan really has the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" unease in the military headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" "Islamisation" "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the suspension of the ban on soldiers for soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the large-scale train in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan issued a further 7395 coup d'etat by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly known as the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they listened to their role as a guardian of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan driveth purposefully an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" "Vocal Europe", "a particularly unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt against persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and salafists in a few years. ""</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this is true, such a development could not allow Nato to be cold."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of the sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adjust" "his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "enthuses True Companion's website."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, if one approaches a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah is disturbing one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" says it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notice their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is leaking out of the edge areas, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the printed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical likeness to real women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a trump-era of the Trump era that the political divisions, which have polarised the US constituency, have also split families in small-format."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican kinship with which they struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite independently on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it seems to me that this also involves considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and" "Trump", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's Uruguayan version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both of which are in fact a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"if Trump is concerned, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals are twisting to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-changing music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it amazes him that so far no application has been able to fulfill the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer for the next possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, under consideration of the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a familiarisation."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Authority, the applicant must demonstrate corresponding degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill it out any more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good mood among the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is confident about the building office and its employees. "</seg>

<seg id="2554">Design is available for a city-builder with great scope.</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own yard and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what fits "when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the retiring city builder."</seg>

<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts have also been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"dairy meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the US causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells which are capable of triggering inflammations are evened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and a diet rich in tryptophan will promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system is working with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separately accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial chromosomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells, but without missing them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment so that they did not have an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the scientists left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the fluid it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same intolerance-promoting cells like mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastro-intestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">High tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous refurbishment projects are a" success project "- it is also important to promote inner development, and not only to develop new areas of construction."</seg>

<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out objectively, that is, per property."</seg>

<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arc" "in which, among other things, it is about the structural condition and the renovation prospects."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month costs taxpayers according to the military specifications left to TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on July 17th at 7 am on the South Lawn for the event, until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security guards stayed on the plane during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it did not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you're locked," "replied the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was referred to as official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the reform of health, which was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for political reasons, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"however, their use only for a photo-operation is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation, when the presidential aircraft performed before the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to decompose the US President at the White House with precise centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was in Germany at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 performed 58 exercise landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted among the training needs of the crew crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flight, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement sets is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things produced in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for whom so many Americans have worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication against the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral capellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their then incorrect assessment of the events."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence against the Domspatzen," two measures "were measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was about" shameful and shameful deeds "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but striking was the" degree of media manipulation, "said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also spoke to the Bavarian Broadcasting Service in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you would like to go to the church and this is a bonded fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth," "blows have been a very normal educational tool," "to cope with bold children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the abuse of abuse, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "Mein brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is written in the 440-page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber asked by the diocese of Regensburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, by Domkapellmeister R., forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to many other defendants, however, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, despite violence, they even associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger Domkapellmeister."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a Domspatz did not have a top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"just eight pages are dedicated to him, and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"the principalities at the preschool, too, took place outside of his sphere of influence."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to reproach him at best, find out of it too late or not take the first hint seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domsplash-gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by almost all interviewees as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his disciples, Georg Ratzinger, also described a very excellent testimony, described him as" warm hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as a very good-natured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" always moved from grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to flood eruptions."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he was deeply regretted for years, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the use of violence at the preschool, these are Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as a matter of fact, one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"many people, who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope, still work diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also accused of any involvement or complicity regarding sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said one person who was affected," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator in a certain way."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the rating of the Ratzinger family-cats in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a dubious student expressed it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it is credited to him... heirs in intrusive or clearer or even more open than their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "that the students and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused of having prevented or brought it to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violent texts" "were read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking away". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge mélange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But precisely this is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is clearly separated: between the preschool and the secondary school of the" "Domspatzen", "between sexual abuse and violence and, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also covers incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were outraged and subjected to horrific suffering, were all acquired at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Domspore gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most of the witnesses stressed, the subject" "primary school" "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domsplash-gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was indeed discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, despite violence, combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the reproach remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he was just beginning to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently left the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium, which the report was even reproducing."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that" in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practised. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were banned long ago in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took advantage of a legal grey area, like everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate the extent that the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit was really exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison term for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians say" "fall-knit of anachronism", "that is, the danger of evaluating past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorred at all times and not for what has been breached in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it is finally working up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slaying ears and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his rainbow time did Georg Ratzinger have shown in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also available for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI says from his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not refuse to lead a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone one makes no big singers and before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger in talking to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I really got to know George Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and sincere people, of whom one could not imagine that he could only do something to a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with how many former Domspatzen still stay in contact with him today, 23 years after his accreditation, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until now, that he once was strict with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to which they still look up today and admiring them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly: all that one reproaches him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, is relieved of it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the contention would lie, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
