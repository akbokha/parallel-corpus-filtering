28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a chef in Boston , had his dream job as a chef in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shocked and destroyed by his death .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone , who would harm his younger brother . &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to combine his way with his family was to always cook us a little , to prepare us for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the lead @-@ on of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always plu@@ gged in drawers or glued from the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , pre @-@ set tv with local de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no need to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the pyramid &apos;s pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted at home in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometre at that pace , I was scared . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the horse &apos;s career ended up again . &quot;
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse he did not even go for photo purposes .
&quot; it was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden So@@ ccer pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight forward . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master champion was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the founder Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the hand @-@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Award was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want .
&quot; the two US presidential candidates , however , are not one in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton lies in a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely rever@@ t to regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities for dis@@ advant@@ aged people to open up and need money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic applicant is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be party @-@ internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the US .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ cap@@ e trade agreement , do not want to sign them . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , too , for instance Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , there is Tru@@ mp who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics point out to him , that the budget deficit would only be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost daily . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a vehicle for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ enced .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised homes for all@@ oted women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich @-@ based women &apos;s help . &quot;
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a bottle of water for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who think that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , mis@@ ses , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed , she appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about what is experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , asking for B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing as lod@@ gings of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses for single women and their children in some common shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or the men and women are housed together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women easily , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much as the women feel this need of protection , one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance in@@ denti@@ sts argue : demands for new labor action measures
Deputy of the Regi@@ stra@@ cians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more employment measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC testified that it would have been appointed ministers to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; persistent &quot; &quot; to problems , which led to the conclusion that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted in favour of completely rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board has now submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work @-@ fighting measures starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance doctors presented this year six times , the first overall cases in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A Assistant Professor , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contractual agreement that had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and adopted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands , and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared nar@@ row@@ ly , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper reported that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if it had never happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ers showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the dow@@ ning of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ched out .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the transgres@@ sion was even greater because it was committed by an alleged friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all . &quot;
&quot; the most serious were the alle@@ gations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of almost his ministry last month by a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television endor@@ sed cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be re @-@ imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the worm stage of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke@@ over is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected organs of the state . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they had not even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw down the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambitions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized headquarters and the stock exchange at Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these trademarks .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , who gives it 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the jubil@@ ation when he picks up the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career strokes &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma has been enthusiastic fans for this kind of sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already had 6,000 profits , if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners in UK .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race but in addition , he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes zu Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin damp@@ ens Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that without giving reasons Putin ordered &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that later he was the head of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Gover@@ nor . &quot;
&quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest friends for a long time , working as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , is the consequence of a type of power struggle ? &quot;
nobody knows that at this moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks by Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entr@@ ust ar@@ duous posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he was familiar with . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term Putin viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series have announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot;
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character Gib@@ son is from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series . &quot;
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act on sandals that were mirr@@ ored by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives approximately 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 incl@@ ine ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown accepted the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a g@@ ong for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents future @-@ proof high @-@ rise and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the North Tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern train bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards in an ascent of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; since the toler@@ ances on which the team works were tiny , they were only a few milli@@ meters on each side . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men were lucky to be alive after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a Bo@@ je hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast@@ guards and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; although the bo@@ ating engine had an emergency stop , the boat was released from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
severely injured - man li@@ stens to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic off@@ ender cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; for this reason , she went out of the house with her companion . &quot;
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old compla@@ ined to his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments for Braunschweig ?
&quot; the SPD and Green Party mean : in the future , investors should be put into duty much more strongly in the future . &quot;
how do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next council meeting , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
&quot; first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; the SPD leader , Christoph Brat@@ man , said : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in stock . &quot;
&quot; the big issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ man says : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder print runs for investors .
&quot; not@@ withstanding that , as Brat@@ man , then a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
&quot; the programme is not yet complete : for the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how can we compensate for the loss of some 1300 low @-@ priced apartments whose support will continue in the coming years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased off @-@ running ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back to price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
&quot; for in the western city , Fri@@ sten is running at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; since the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , one is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there shouldn &apos;t be a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; teen@@ age and child will no longer go out to play , but rather prefer spending their free time to star@@ ing on screens has been compla@@ ined in the last decade of many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out with their smartphones to the outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app that followed 35@@ ,000 users recently reported that within two days after launching the game , the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take 30 minutes of time to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; beat on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even close friends on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are gru@@ elling game corruption that always has to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should I do ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people hunt more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bal@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget about the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Ap@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast became a multi @-@ champion title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ schafts@@ kam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American female Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ nt on the float bar during the individual multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected her last check in Brazil , a competition that wasn &apos;t so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bal@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women at the Winter Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although it insisted , during their long journey to the top , never to have planned the future , that is not really true . &quot;
&quot; part of their land exercises - containing their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is designed for Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio . &quot;
this is not by chance .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any competition , a winning stre@@ ak which will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
floating beams and ground cores - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title .
&quot; she again picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her du@@ de - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on low glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their soil practi@@ sing , she cast down kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in a series of mur@@ der@@ ous mur@@ der@@ ers killed in the car in a car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous attack by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis Dau@@ ghter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting was temp@@ ting the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in h@@ is@@ panic living quarters in nine attacks and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used multiple vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which crashed on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his age @-@ mates Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I did not create this . &quot;
I don &apos;t create this .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has left it on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to identify them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has devised for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some signs on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the virus infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t been asked for a forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa demanded tens of thousands of sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood early warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still headed people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , rose greatly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and flo@@ ated , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone told about 13,@@ 75 inch of rain from midnight to Friday morning . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been fully absorbed by the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and dis@@ courses in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an Affili@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa dump@@ ed 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were both flooded now .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the disaster manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison count@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but on Friday there were no reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , shop manager at Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police agree that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ore Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
assault rif@@ les for assault rif@@ les traced back to various assault rif@@ les over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a constant struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were sockets . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there have been several armed fighters involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; reported police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qui@@ ver on her arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
it reco@@ vers and the police are still searching for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the tower and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at any summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second , this team has three tur@@ ners , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin colors . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is catho@@ lic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champi@@ onships in Simone Bal@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gymnas@@ tics all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ners in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like Tur@@ ns are a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymnas@@ tics that can be maintained by parents who are responsible for training , education , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bal@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the communities of Au@@ n innumerable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easily accessible gym training . &quot;
I was founded 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is so exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors who voted in a vote refused him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans revealed plans to introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend bites to improve the care at irregular times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of BM@@ A Kom@@ mitt@@ ee for Assistance , announced last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and will meet it to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by discussions met with the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the result of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the resident doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further training measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors at the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants better week@@ end@@ payments for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not affect only little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the past two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistants and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ job with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were returning from a professional time , training c@@ ough , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can lower heart inf@@ ar@@ ction risk &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form bel@@ lows .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the stream of blood and blocked the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another heart attack .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes electoral fraud blo@@ om in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ uses the police , election observers and city halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on grounds of &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of bal@@ lot boxes to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a reference with them in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er only needs to call his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to the finger of a person when they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only aimed at election fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral scandal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ armed to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it reads : &quot; &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot;
there have been concerns that ... state institutions have deliberately ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensi@@ tivities to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists process letter selection papers to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ aping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social welfare purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing after your identification .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are optional .
a three year limit to requests for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists process full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes from letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set off barriers to set up electoral stations .
a change of law facilit@@ ated by an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Legisl@@ ation Act 1983 ) .
photography ban in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff usually enforce that voters go alone in the voting cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was made . &quot;
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as in@@ compatible , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ti@@ cking controls &quot; of the election @-@ registration departments of the city halls .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycling athlete Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ tune of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by far not the only athlete with its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you are allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I take it as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ ski@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her large expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African Swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who similarly has heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the similarities .
theory in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user in Facebook explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons include Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; as a pig died

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers called &quot; as low off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m breast@@ stroke squ@@ ad@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who had been taken aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as he called , he died as a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language .
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the I@@ di@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on stream .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free @-@ sty@@ ling pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many were talking about him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ cies via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing in the programme and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention to act as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympi@@ ad , he said . &quot;
I have referred to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try for under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to make the situation worse , she pat@@ tern@@ ed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf . &quot;
they continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back to the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off her own stock@@ ings trousers and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything .
she did not seem to distur@@ b someone observing someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how re@@ pu@@ di@@ ly to think that someone would take care of someone who had another person and who did not have been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the pieces out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled her out and she wasn &apos;t washed .
&quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming in question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect oneself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Mas@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if you approached from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; move out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to do Mas@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ bery , it is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ outs for a guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - by making some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the idea of le@@ aning the pur@@ ge of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left anything he qu@@ en@@ ched , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task was definitely placed under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
&quot; his test line showed a lumin@@ ometric speed of more than 4,000 units . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after its lumin@@ ometric speed was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this is coming close to the worst thing I have had in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not going to dock here , because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us that contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking just about the products , we wanted to put them into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; &quot; let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked out some of the things I told him to lick up like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to teach Ian to lick them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing the added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irre@@ parable condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed g@@ aping holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , working for house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive shou@@ ting , stri@@ kers and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti@@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing deco@@ ded her and her partner violent this week by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anybody . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see ab@@ used to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ oc@@ ation is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

house administration workers will now have to cut waste moun@@ ds that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of the sei@@ zure of a class B drug in commercial custody .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it was assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that they will del@@ oc@@ ate tenants who do not adhere to the house rules .

&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without any self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior , which will continue to work together with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal deposited in panic after an open military jet over@@ flies beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force put an unbelievable crash
&quot; the Air Force announced that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk . &quot;
this was the moment in which scared tourists start to panic after a ne@@ ph@@ ew jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew near to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal almost within reach of the sun worshi@@ ppers .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the wet@@ lands , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was on the surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokesman said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to poor visibility in the area surrounding them , but the air forces insisted that the safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; this summer , land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his view
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with concerns about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back @-@ game rises three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must refrain from competing with the sub@@ le@@ vi@@ ed Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe league champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who is competing with Brazil the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a b@@ anding dust in the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request was settled at least for the first time in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision in this respect so far , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications took the lead . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; at 3 : 2 at Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. weren &apos;t really convinced yet . &quot;
&quot; Sevilla also has the 2 : 3 defeat after length@@ ening in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate league table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; thus the world @-@ ranking first ranked the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ alist Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ ku@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made the title to each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic deal was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and time outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they had pulled back to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their guns at fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts pos@@ ing with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; through the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected thrilling match did not evolve . &quot;
but nevertheless sufficient stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ ku@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in its quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had moved into a breach of breach , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way in similar high table tennis ages Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now has short@@ com@@ ings in his election campaign in the so @-@ called Republi@@ can High burg U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own republi@@ can camp , there is no doubt about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong@@ ly reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
sw@@ inging Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were surprised by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Senate CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he makes no difference , as &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party should have threatened to raise funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will get stronger for Congress . &quot;
Olympic : three sc@@ ams at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C plans to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Brazil Games .
&quot; following a fraud test at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee promptly communicated a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , handed down a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Ken@@ y@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has sought the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to enforce its own investigations and issued an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , handed down and signed the trial , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich has been in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics team leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been dra@@ fted off the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was allegedly arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , Kenya has been under special supervision at the IO@@ C for numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , an unusual warning was that athletes from Kenya and Russia were especially targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have repeatedly been asser@@ ted that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he had hired her in the Russian athle@@ tics industry . &quot;
it was demonstrated that in this sport @-@ type was widespread and systematically absorbed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , like Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth room with the role of Maria .
&quot; the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria in this staging .
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright . &quot;
&quot; it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of its movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London School maid that joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family experienced a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that they were killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people think of ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of a vote in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land with a certain amount of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a narr@@ ator from Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked with Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge of the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ations Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be the mini@@ ons of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he also stated , &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp is un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ i@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; Tre@@ ats wants nude cal@@ orie for &quot; &quot; women and men &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ aner in order to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous nude people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nu@@ g magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys differ , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the opinion that the Calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classical nude , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community comp@@ utes with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish municipality of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of refugees who escape from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective hunters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the leader of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k on Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal charges several months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the vain put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the head of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities . &quot;
so Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition parties . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ arians , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum entitled asylum seekers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as &quot; &quot; asylum seekers &quot; &quot; ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or a lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual persec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid as so far it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day bal@@ lad - that is bit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on the way U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count votes in the end , only to drive out lab@@ ori@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass election campaigns over the people over it . &quot;
the hot phase when you can say it at all has just begun .
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strong new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alism .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors have got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel gives the blame to the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you &apos;re at the right place to campaign for the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations ; Angela Merkel is lying in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not right , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; charged Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame to no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , co@@ ke , play only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also realised that in the country , its base is crum@@ bling that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ ses of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ suff@@ erer Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , any birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats la@@ gged behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday hard@@ ship and largely transfer their electoral campaign into the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go to search for local stimul@@ i under the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just goes with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; it will also be praised for the construction of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the transport through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; says the Vice President Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation project . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eps were searching and rather familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community increased the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exagger@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made himself a position on the spot himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been bitten .
the fastest was on the road with 77 hours per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has passed , it has become cal@@ mer . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue arri@@ vals in them , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; course of course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily captured are the restaurants along the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
the revenue decl@@ ines it &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the restructuring of the road has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , president @-@ president Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous is handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also very nice somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; according to G@@ öh@@ ner , that his family @-@ clientele returns to the end of the renovation work , there is no doubt about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly scre@@ wed to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a state of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; said the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ demand anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was lod@@ ged in results and reached a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had enough time to hide his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and but@@ t jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything , which has no chances at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas will be presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
some of them have in part : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before deportation .
&quot; refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance , and disclose social media accounts for a safety review . &quot;
&quot; in case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
many things also seem un@@ earth@@ ed and are open to questions .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high refugee numbers , many people worried about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that people deeply deal with , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has moved tremend@@ ously into the focus .
&quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly placing themselves in position on the issue of inner security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ten@@ tious dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lab@@ ori@@ ously struggles here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double pass , he does nothing . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to benefit from the issue of inner security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery charges are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but it is not running in all markets .
&quot; in the recall action , there are verteb@@ ras around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts up with deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can further highlight a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July the core brand VW decreased mainly in Western Europe and again loaded the total sales , as the company listed in the Da@@ x company . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
deliveries in the home market Germany declined by almost a sixth .
&quot; head of sales , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a decline in sales in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um had also bur@@ dened the exit from the EU , explained a spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ement was first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the princip@@ ally affected home brand of the Lower Saxony already got off lightly due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is be@@ ech . &quot;
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to forward a sales split from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , with a total of 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust gas test .
&quot; in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , Volkswagen confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car park represents a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason to be legal fin@@ es .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for modified diesel models .
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has full compliance with the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; depar@@ tures from this are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW took over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the change@@ over did not take place and all type approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen can see that for example , half a year after retro@@ fitting , customers may come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the case of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the scandal , comes to an uncertainty about possible warranty claims as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands a number of rich as@@ par@@ ag@@ us in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; do not need to pay for their savings pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 per cent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee covers the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 cost will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he had 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not be able to utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; said the banking manager . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs now continue . &quot;
&quot; leaving cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the banking committee . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other assets .
few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to bear them alone , be &quot; economically dur@@ ably not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ ge- and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pun@@ ches for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay flat charges for deposits , and competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said that at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if she pays for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , no other banks are known to the Association of Co@@ operatives that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken , and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before moving to the comment section , to clear it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ en@@ ame men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ development of vinyl records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who bought a record recently are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hormone by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers better keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I wear a modest gray suit in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , before I stop , hold my hands and speak a bit of sentim@@ ents like : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; art from Glasgow , 55 , which I got from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men of middle @-@ age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , rev@@ et the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took impetus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that wake up happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or ownership of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get involved mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee ki@@ cks off from a record stack . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record cannot own record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I leaf@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound @-@ plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musical . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a pale audience , when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ t@@ packaged pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ aned from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but next mental trauma is hard to imagine if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes window bum@@ ps than a big shopping .
&quot; she does not earn much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; she casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I gave the impression to mu@@ ster the jeans pants , I observed a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cro@@ sley plate player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that spends most of luxury goods such as records . &quot;
&quot; even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in labs in Soh@@ o , do not consider the large number of female collectors in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stro@@ lling through plate @-@ stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they steer clear of the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year false present@@ er who rises above the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects proposal on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle of refugee camps
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be demol@@ ished , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that contain a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they assumed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp which is community @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that closing &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations &quot; Help Refu@@ ge@@ es und L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migran@@ ts &quot; estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle was up to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ appointing appearance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ pros Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down . &quot;
&quot; I keep watching the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he must analyse in peace , which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;
&quot; at the time pass in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything that we have changed lately .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are to be particularly effective . &quot;
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement tra@@ ilers from the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident areas where mobile measurement by the police would be too dangerous .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to san@@ i@@ tising bridges with temporary speed limits , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ ender for maintaining speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days at un@@ interrupted measurement operations , the case data are transmitted encrypted by a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans after time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to sound , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also slip @-@ resistant outer casing disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic &apos;s specifications in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
United Kingdom gets silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold is fet@@ ched
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a score of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
&quot; Fiji issued a master class in handling , side qu@@ il@@ ting , back , line run and power to win gold - her first Olympic Games of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England of Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind them .
&quot; eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they just lost one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji had a wonderful start and caused the attacks to boun@@ ce off G@@ Bs .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upward , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ro@@ ared in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a tent@@ ative T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u stressed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ ph@@ ers , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ushing in the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ ate gold compared to those games and that &apos;s what you want .
&quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; there were three voices in the boat . the response of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic @-@ old in a second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that made such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th un@@ compressed use , which is also unparalleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make up the difference and no one was more powerful than the coach who did not know if he was to survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term at all under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but it makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts were about Williams , who spent a gru@@ es@@ ome morning talking about anything else and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much it means to me , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was said some time ago in the original one in a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the con@@ fes@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group is &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the association for 31 years , is 28 years old as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , transports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and extended from the water pipe construction and maintenance work via office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re @-@ acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no stand@@ still and I have repeatedly added innovations because water is life @-@ consuming and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived through the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; for that , he received a lot of praise and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised the water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal pop .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ organisation of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest job , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high @-@ can@@ ister at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high @-@ can@@ ister from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .

&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;

relationship management in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - People shooting at a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and was mort@@ ally wounded .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man we@@ ars a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but she confirmed that a person had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation squ@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) , said Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers , who use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption , to ask for the cash register . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent occurs . &quot;
but this too will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry have particular significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation continued to exac@@ erb@@ ate China &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer of producers in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand of mass steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw in price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have sprung up . &quot;
it is not clear how long the price pick@@ up is .
German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp last but not wanted to exclude closure of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the steel Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates an increase in order intake thanks to an improved order situation . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; from several perspectives , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German sen@@ iors division . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often dissolve in age , and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and to organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly call their lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ste as quickly as they do in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia sing themselves to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires special power , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adjusting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially the elderly , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do something for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; I would like to say that Live@@ z@@ illa is a great , yet simple chat application at an unbe@@ ate@@ able price . &quot;
&quot; if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can direct themselves directly to the church or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react more sensi@@ bly as a han@@ go@@ ver on the cries of the young
&quot; in Hanover , bi@@ ologists have investigated the effect of the rep@@ aid of cat cell phones to adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the du@@ st@@ master of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cries is different with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
&quot; they were presented for a herd of little ones , taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers consider their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cries , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ oth said . &quot;
they turned faster to the driver when this rep@@ ut@@ ment of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may be con@@ genital or development with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; in addition , some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist reported in Marina Sche@@ er@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former So@@ ccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey again takes place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of the arch @-@ rivals between Be@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line in Kon@@ ya is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even in the suspension of the emergency situation after the fall of the fall in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , it is not possible to stop football even before the football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , Sü@@ ku@@ r living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ku@@ r is supposed to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by the president Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Erdo@@ gan declared the noc@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict refusal of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at cup winner &quot; Gala , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will be able to arrive especially again . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Cologne in Cologne proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also ki@@ cks off in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the Southern Li@@ g , it was only six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ret@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig laid the foundation for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez settlement under the Treaty and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas had only been announced after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the falls would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce approximately one third of its annual volume of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had already been closed twice for Dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a Dop@@ ing lock compla@@ ined their start right before the games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly pi@@ ped out and bu@@ sted at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scenario : with a raised smile , she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was established that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; however , there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already been locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than ever before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after det@@ ecting the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the legal ing@@ es@@ tion and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ed Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete was subsequently recognized as many medals . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave the Olympic silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized as a bronze medal , was given back to CA@@ S due to a verdict of the International Sports Court . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positively in May but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champi@@ ons , evidence was found on the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement , the barrier of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
she planned her hom@@ ec@@ oming for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at some 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sions went up again , another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; when det@@ on@@ ating near the popular beach town of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ ad@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesperson in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had received secret indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - although they were not informed about the exact time and locations . &quot;
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the current bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and environ@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim population , there is no need to travel into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , will re@@ ap the benefit of restoring the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identical movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several state offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists have also placed the group under observation under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; points for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; said Chief Executive Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are treated in extrem@@ ist fashion . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement now too .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ tion@@ aries in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identity . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ zen said that his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to pron@@ ounce them with a young language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ eten said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in ri@@ gh@@ oti@@ ated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ eten said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be law @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other rights @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form , plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of rights @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; he expressed concern about the fact that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before , were concerned . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the suspect in attacks on asylum lod@@ gings were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sli@@ pped so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently used for viral interaction . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his course with a 48 @-@ second reg@@ atta and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men run in ae@@ dic@@ s , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as the &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale . &quot;
&quot; referring to a &quot; prosperity belly , &quot; the British tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; made itself funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to play alone in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; f@@ rene@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition .
a seat in the front row for the stunning architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles
&quot; learn more about the history of the Central Library in the city centre , as the Society of Archit@@ ec@@ tural Anti @-@ Southern California Chapter holds a salon with Arnold Schwar@@ tz@@ man and Stephen Ge@@ e , the author of the new book &quot; Los Angeles Central Library : a History of its Art and Architecture . &quot; &quot;

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the Neue Platz has been sol@@ dered .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their shop on Monday at 17.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock the next morning , 250 euros had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tru@@ mp does not look so close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
&quot; the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tru@@ mp , speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot;
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp is losing the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either swing or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post asc@@ ends to trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently large .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the Post Office plans to offer its electric vans on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered to other establishments . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Board Jürgen Ger@@ ber had said that there are always questions , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon be entering the mass production of vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ ber announced that the Group wanted to enlarge its fleet of electric cars , and to make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we reloc@@ ate the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K @-@ leadership steps down after dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ drops suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K had gu@@ essed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uns@@ af@@ e , the longer the successes promised by him remain . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of the company leadership stands the world &apos;s number five in front of a personnel new beginning .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the management in the Management Board already took over the board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger as of September 1 , 2012 , and informed the company . &quot;
&quot; he is supposed to take over the function of a &quot; &quot; Chairman of the Executive Board &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the withdrawal , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation . &quot;
&quot; details , however , did not want to mention a company spokesman on Friday . &quot;
anyone who will become the market research company in the future is still unclear .
&quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring introduced several years ago was great . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder becomes rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
sales of € 7@@ 1.2 million declined by 3.4 percent to the first half of the year .
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter rose above all due to its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , reported a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million to the Group . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into dig@@ ging in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n : eight injured
eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) during an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers .
&quot; two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , reported the police . &quot;
&quot; according to her statements , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t her data from an opposite vice , which was partly on the counter @-@ road . &quot;
the bus arrived on the right side of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six emergency ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will be 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of now 2.@@ 10 euros ( up to now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ ure 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a ra@@ bid calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that under@@ cover for these sewage installations . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board , a re@@ calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can be compensated . &quot;
&quot; the serious fee increases were founded by Schmidt , that in all three wastewater facilities , there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; in addition , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair costs , in all three systems , the period in the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period fell to a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the wastewater system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
&quot; in the pumping station Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken from the ground and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed after nearly 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the required maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants , the expenditure for operation and maintenance was &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the sewage installations over the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sewage association could not be expanded by these facilities because it concerns public defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % was de@@ bit@@ ed .
the annual average flow of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared to the previous month , a rise in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat enables approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm gets to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused that the App Black@@ face would promote or propag@@ ate white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and lap@@ sed che@@ eks , some critics called it rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ face . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable &quot; and said to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and appliances we all hold in their hands . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to anticipate sensi@@ bility .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and challenged others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices for snap@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company has recently set up a personnel officer who focuses on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , on his part , said that she will shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; counter@@ fei@@ ting IS@@ IS Secret service information , sets out Committee of Congress &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to portra@@ y a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual states were allowed to report in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can Committee , secret service committees and the military budget committee , reports on great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence lists who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information typically attracted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders posted a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions were allowed on site and were more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after it was played , that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State . &quot;
the report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; proclaimed the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the General In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s investigations were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes between more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team noted that despite the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , the government had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s condem@@ nation , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember having ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first one will take a little longer to the strong Dutch girl who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket ( her two older sisters played the sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the near @-@ range .
&quot; without victory in the tournament India had gone into the game , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ band protection to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athlete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could have been well known under these famous names , which were sent to the Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als , if he was a float , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign long .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many people I asked didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 has had an athlete who has made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider &apos;s charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ ages ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in her quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also in the broad@@ casts a further hei@@ gh@@ tened goal : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful ambition is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing even when watching these games .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wolf into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympics @-@ man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ gling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia breaking together ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid alliance of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses testified that police shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; according to Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terror attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options apart from prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethi@@ op@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ des , which have been defeated more or less in recent years , will av@@ ail of tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess now explo@@ de beneath the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians admitted that they were so har@@ dest to get together .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ae@@ dic@@ s predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too is changing .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ res@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which constitute about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethi@@ op@@ ian Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Northern Ethi@@ op@@ ian region from the Tig@@ ray region , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the statements of analysts , were apparently fu@@ eled by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal en@@ vy of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters arrested in Gon@@ dar , an official city , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ate hike . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ing that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who try to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position , to explain statements he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp went back to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insisted on insi@@ sting that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism r@@ att@@ led to Mr. Tru@@ mp while he was trying to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation falling down due to falling commodities .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton chat@@ ted to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp was trying to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone as his cargo values have continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while reinfor@@ cing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ zes brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it rear @-@ bro@@ ker , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on any of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ aned the poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once beyond the price of the market , café arrives in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced . &quot;
soap Cher@@ ie shop selling Ver@@ b in summer 2014 sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people depl@@ ored it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also a new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions . &quot;
there are natural tears .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the verb . &quot;
&quot; even after she went to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the rob@@ bery had closed , she gave a while to the coffee @-@ ring , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was the cup of coffee and culture that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the decline in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal is still receiving his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took over the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for tasting with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to leave them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a home return was felt . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies from Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s sea tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ s last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick was told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag shows the history of American cuisine during Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small local snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the crash crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable soup ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter asked Hack@@ ett , this found the pair suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women boiled for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the paths with which the country was dealing with it no longer to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods that recy@@ cle the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way of resi@@ ding food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mixtures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy dishes . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes prescri@@ p@@ tions , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - such as the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen kitchen of his kitchen , he served as the million heavy man of the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was very un@@ realistic .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt would probably have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to take an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the present day of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt means that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how she could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she made people ill . &quot;
there was the storm of wind .
&quot; after the plates arrived at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roosev@@ elt did lunch at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a common trick , modest recipes to miss a fancy name . &quot;
&quot; there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; aston@@ ish@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ ger he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; Some hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he used his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung has so far saved almost 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives to the game in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , but he said , &quot; &quot; For me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack by himself , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from the short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks get offspring only with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a rich 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , comments this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist long ago assumed that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie will become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
their time @-@ pent@@ ei@@ ves measured it when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt down sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers to the bottom .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues therefore examined 28 Greenland H@@ ouses that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably lots of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; therefore , their birth was supposed to lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt to tow large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the lens nucleus em@@ its a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th anniversary in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucleus , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res should be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year old har@@ po@@ on tip was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a fl@@ aming flame . &quot;
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest more in a long life . &quot;
construction site in double pack
&quot; with topics related to building construction , the Municipal Council has focused primarily on the latest meeting . &quot;
&quot; the panel was facilit@@ ated by the mayor , Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently identified resi@@ dences can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the development , par@@ cel@@ eration and access issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way for interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , building will@@ s can immediately report in the town hall , about the allocation of the plots the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to accommodate requests for the settlement of further industrial enterprises , coupled with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of under@@ time lar@@ n , the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main , therefore , has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores continue to operate from London through financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the UK . &quot;
this is especially true for large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk cor@@ ps ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it also cuts worse in the infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city boasts easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;

Gilead takes legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ der and other non @-@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US officials Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in the cost incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ alize with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and took advantage of laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir water@@ proof@@ ed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the United States supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a spokesman for the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ CS ) , following the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they delivered over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , allied with the P@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are doing cleaning up , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine of Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a blat@@ ant contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ porters in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax inspection by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not complete . &quot;
&quot; critics , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his forms of business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday to announce his tax return in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp .
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on economics in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that for two years , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat , Tru@@ mp to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS , and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were paid as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; her main investment position was an inexpensive index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ bic , fire@@ work body support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ili@@ zers .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its promotion together with the U.S. Nature Conservation by using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the world @-@ phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants out of their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; will be cast . &quot;
&quot; the mix with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , which ends up to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom sp@@ ans up with a b@@ ang and spark@@ les fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ y into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last option is a thro@@ wer that shoots a gold @-@ burning fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish Director breaks down Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ mons - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arab guests were requested by an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; published his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director approached the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; shot him &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliberate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it provoked even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big response on the Internet , where people called the whole thing a scandal . &quot;
some submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged aff@@ or@@ tions of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all charges and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; Not to include Israel in the hot@@ key list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police susp@@ ects tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police repression of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot;
&quot; some of the prot@@ esters looked at Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president , Michel Tem@@ er on walls . &quot;
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian enterprises on businesses in the country grew strongly , informed the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is embark@@ ing on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , Russian foreign representation delivered around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year have broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot; &quot;
evidence sought : beverage market in forest oil falling over
a rob@@ bery case has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the Be@@ acon XXL beverage market at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the slogan of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the hand of the drink market and then fled at first by foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators must have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and must be f@@ lown from the gravel car park located opposite the park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations about the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 a.m. ) should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer holidays
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the Nag@@ old Child Protection League with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holiday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first week of school holidays , the lively group was quartered in the quiet area of leisure . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ rescue by visiting the zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their own cour@@ tiers such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful pieces of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of their hom@@ ec@@ oming , the sun was laughing and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day hike from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in the past two years , the Secretary General of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and we finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the open gate of mercy on Freiburg Min@@ ster was a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern was on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s crosses and par@@ ted the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman , and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and lyrics in the morning and evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els and churches again and again went to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were provided . &quot;
&quot; at the stage , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; on top of that , one stepped down the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of distance , but had to recover some 500 metres of altitude in the case of s@@ wollen heat and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
&quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God thank@@ ed God . &quot;
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , who arrived at the pilgrimage destination , were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scot@@ t@@ land Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the velo@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Glasgow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself E@@ igen . the J@@ P made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who were victorious four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard round the New Zealand won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation that drove in a higher course to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s rivals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has been won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form Kenn@@ y , it &apos;s possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had argued yesterday with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which continues and ends tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a crowd of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; there was drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid sex@@ ism and murder charges as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to lifting the energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby repe@@ aling all supply contracts , such as supplying energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision at Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt refin@@ ing consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
&quot; this step follows the long @-@ standing speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , informed that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L informed that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual drop of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; guarantee the power supply to the melt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it has withdrawn from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; referring to the analy@@ st statements at the beginning of the week , the head of operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts annually and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ress and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan are on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping @-@ up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a fri@@ vol@@ ous reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é story almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an image tape as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover@@ stars is so eag@@ erly awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leak before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there have been clearly more celeb@@ ri@@ ties that are model@@ ed as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador , J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence , was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - is under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or youths from today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success does not suit everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them &quot; the mi@@ sty of the moment . &quot;
these feelings re @-@ cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying down on the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres reject 160@@ ,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid posts are rejected annually by the local community centres , while the industry is moving to the effects of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ons and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is scheduled that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l Municip@@ ality Council said that the last survey of the National Union of Commun@@ al Research Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Law Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from major services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with confusing and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need will be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Ministry of Justice and Federal jus@@ tiz@@ ens and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately cancel these short cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its promise to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers &apos; communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign charged after employees allegedly pulling weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after she has been told that her campaign leader for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on an employee in February , while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally , before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger and ra@@ mmed the course at Vinc@@ ent@@ k@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; stated B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having appe@@ aled to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; stated B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate saw an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges . &quot;
the campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and of Philip , due to bodily injury and permanent mental damage . &quot;
&quot; for a statement , Tru@@ mp Press spokesperson on Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be achieved . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip just failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls to his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has led a controversial campaign . &quot;
&quot; the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tru@@ mp For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties . &quot;
this yiel@@ ded representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD r@@ ushed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled just before the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be at 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD , according to the survey , only reached 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; this led to 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates wouldn &apos;t miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover , Germany , as an &quot; office in western pocket format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit dist@@ ressing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in August 1996 , no one could suspect that Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smart phone era . &quot;
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster that was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today controls suppliers that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple , are accounted for by alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
&quot; after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course for itself . &quot;
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone out , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local authorities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as in 2012 in London , when we operated a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging He@@ a@@ throw is too great . &quot;
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ass on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers had wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome but He@@ a@@ throw answers any asked question .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse @-@ play &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there would be blocking signs on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition on which part of the page advertising is adver@@ tised . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the announ@@ cing open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of scor@@ eboard makers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying scor@@ ers have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use scor@@ eboard , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has it on ad block@@ ers on Desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on Desktop PCs accounts for a large share of revenues , so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be updating its &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertisement . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed Ad@@ Blo@@ c would wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we focus instead on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman suspected of presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police call on witnesses after a woman drow@@ ned in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several cars on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them as well as every witness of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter said to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; that &apos;s something the public prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after taking a man over and killed , who lay on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ yed atmosphere , and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day @-@ side @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable once , Venus -- over several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as a Trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned as trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it takes it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly coordinated with the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had fired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy has been awarded the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the night @-@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces of Montreal &apos;s Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour disputes relating to remuneration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the conflic@@ ting parties put themselves at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current strike , &quot; says a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to re@@ address the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group awarded the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and all over the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve around different rates in star@@ ches , as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods with planetary creation are . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the quick@@ est .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rot@@ ting pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the sample rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star comes down
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base zu Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) explained . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the League , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old still should not be included in the glory of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted , between 2001 and 2003 banned stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis scandal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the principal suspect to have received the anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot;
also its farewell @-@ days don &apos;t run sil@@ ently .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy and sympathy from the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch @-@ riv@@ alled Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle runner , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday , Ch@@ en had demonstrated the hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de di@@ ure@@ tic , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Criminal Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news was se@@ eping through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; declared the athletes . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is alleged that the banned substance is the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for the exception of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation @-@ nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the previous ver@@ ges in China had also taken care of violent clas@@ hes between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of free style , I want to commit myself , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun also focused on an examination with Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been tested positively in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ onships to the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ one stimul@@ ant , but had to sit just a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; data E@@ ger : so per@@ fi@@ de , hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som &quot;
the program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetrators in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the cul@@ pr@@ its speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software to attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to ex@@ tor@@ ed ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently seeing a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most paint programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of sales by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop business operation completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; several hospitals in Germany have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpetrators &quot; demand in the face of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a sort of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , create freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are saved by a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five dig@@ its in order to get back their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the present malware Kits were created by the malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set from a criminal and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per certified computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is well @-@ known for many companies that secure their data better . &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey place their trust in preventing ran@@ som@@ ware through file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful replacement , the offen@@ ders threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetrators will also be able to set new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat that was connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the offen@@ ders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit surface is falling apart . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles are the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ speed and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair , thereby offering storage space ranging from floor to ceiling height 1.@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded very well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions .
&quot; he should do his work slightly more quietly , though . &quot;
the consumption of daily consumption is 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is well @-@ balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the top @-@ variant &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment is not open to any wishes . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed regulator responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if required .
&quot; however , full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and HDMI ports lie beneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly cum@@ ber@@ some .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not liable : crash on passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that no liability is possible only with hazards , which are typical of air traffic . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer pay
&quot; after their journey , the sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is doubt@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the trial case , a family was badly injured in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their stay . &quot;
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective treatment plant which rep@@ uted the sea water .
the family considered that the trip had been poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; in other words , he did not violate his duties . &quot;
&quot; especially in the samples of water , no contam@@ in@@ ants were found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 people from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; according to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terrorism .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminal offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this increases safety and strengthens the population &apos;s approval for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère seeks to implement the proposals until 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel recru@@ iting of the security forces , &quot; in medium @-@ scale magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon right will be improved so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot;
the recently discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly obj@@ ected to action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a ban on bur@@ ka and the abolition of the dual nationality .
&quot; as a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , it is un@@ constitutional . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talking about rules about traffic or for witnesses can be heard .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist p@@ act power and ability to manoeu@@ vre .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the stay on the right bring no more security to people in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway br@@ inger
it st@@ alls on the street on a regular basis - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the law enforcement is to be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all motor@@ cyclists , who are in traffic on the surrounding street every evening in the traffic jams , when they travel via the motorway &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger &quot; &quot; ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction is extended by 700 metres in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler road . &quot;
drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is split early on , thus improving the overall production process on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district council of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing at the train station makes driving safer especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return route extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler Street .
&quot; from here , traffic is only chann@@ elled via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built before a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb heavy @-@ duty traffic in particular . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related daily traffic jams continue , the competent regional company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining length of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is to be expected . &quot;
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday by a lane on the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatres are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Kinder@@ haus Wald@@ schule has a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the production in the Small House between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class have come from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the press release of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night for Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ board scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , belong to the fastest star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep anymore . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders speak ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ eping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; just falling asleep many people feel inadequate or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there are organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors behind it , but also medication . &quot;
&quot; not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
&quot; for example , those who have a disk failure can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , We@@ eß will give an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month or at least three nights a week , you should go to the doctor , tell us . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is beaten down , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classical bed@@ time tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is little to be left in Germany , emphas@@ ised Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should contact your GP when you sleep problems . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with examinations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , if you are unable to find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , the medical officer will advise you in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , with sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a breakdown disorder . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; just make no n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the dressing you go to bed at your normal time .
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping room . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which you can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ eß will count on : regular sleeping and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and at night not watch at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he got gold for the first time at the world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler presented himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates who were standing in the review . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets $ 20,000 bonus and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 , nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how it should be kept with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; says the choice @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : gang of luggage det@@ ain@@ ees arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civil servants of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
&quot; as a gang , the susp@@ ects had committed several pockets and bags of luggage . &quot;
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised a gang in the Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to polic@@ emen from past theft charges . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year , and have been working in a collaborative , working @-@ friendly manner and especially professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the criminal comm@@ iss@@ ary 34 can prove four deeds to the thi@@ eves , who were specifically admitted to commit crimes to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few Lin@@ den@@ broo@@ ks , in between still some rest cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem so at first sight , but the police count them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; going along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bike trail . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly &quot; has jumped to the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are prefer@@ enti@@ ally illustrated with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as the &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were evacu@@ ated , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners were re@@ building the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers pulled away under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained before late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who prefers three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the home projects , they share the concern for increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished to make a majority of police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between occup@@ iers and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; unlike the rest of the city , Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was a traditional working @-@ class quarter , which also has a lower average and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under great police custody in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and suff@@ ber@@ ers from all over the world : residents of GDR times and former domestic squ@@ ads now share their neighborhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them in disc@@ arded disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with dy@@ es .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes do not constitute damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer there in the R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously moved into the R@@ ī@@ ga Stra@@ it - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly demanded German sovereignty over the bor@@ ough in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well cared for here are living here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not see violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for those who anno@@ yed themselves about color bombs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; who pul@@ ls out should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district , who can complain poorly on noise . &quot;
all persons presented with first names have asked to not be called with their proper name .
&quot; Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le , a new refugee commission &quot;
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer from the working circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ le@@ ch@@ le is there , the un@@ solved Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work , was sought after . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes , as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 % job for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; for some time now , a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
you must bring the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Land Council to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work , so it is necessary to rely on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community dwell@@ ings need to be dish@@ ear@@ tened , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and employment for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ one or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the construction yard or help house master , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ ch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people should develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and honorary officials jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and can make them useful for the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , too , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ ch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two of the most recent incidents fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer quite clearly , &quot; some nai@@ ve may call . &quot; a residual risk can and should not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins brought them completely into obli@@ vi@@ on .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials must look for jobs on site and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot;
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would un@@ wind the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher , too , has already been utilized to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew in different areas for about an hour - without success .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family home in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday mor@@ nings .
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ls bore . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute the police , the police deployed several crew scra@@ pers as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag went without success .
perhaps the unknown fell in front of the apartment or at their escape .
