<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, they hunted at home in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometre at that pace, I was scared."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the horse's career ended up again."</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the plant of the ALRV on a horse he did not even go for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"it was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Soccer pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already rebuked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talents for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight forward."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master champion was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the founder Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum of the hand-baller Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company wandered to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Award was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential candidates, however, are not one in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies in a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively revert to regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities for disadvantaged people to open up and need money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would increase," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the future, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energy with its investment programme:" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpcape trade agreement, do not want to sign them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, too, for instance Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, there is Trump who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics point out to him, that the budget deficit would only be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost daily."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a vehicle for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fenced.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralised homes for alloted women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich-based women's help."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope-makers," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the flight:" "many secretly steal away because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs call for a bottle of water for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who think that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, misses, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the North of Munich are traumatized, she appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to speak openly about what is experienced, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, there are more accommodations just for them, asking for Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing as lodgings of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabians alone, fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses for single women and their children in some common shelters."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or the men and women are housed together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and accessible for women easily, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much as the women feel this need of protection, one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy of the Registracians have called on their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more employment measures starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC testified that it would have been appointed ministers to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" "persistent" "to problems, which led to the conclusion that the contract was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In consideration of this, the JDC Board has voted in favour of completely rejecting the proposed new treaty and requesting official renegotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the government's silence, the JDC Board has now submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating work-fighting measures starting at the beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="11">"the director of the BMA Assistant Professor, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contractual agreement that had been recommended by the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands, and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared narrowly, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan would have behaved as if it had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolers showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutched out.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The transgression was even greater because it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins is difficult if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of almost his ministry last month by a failed coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television endorsed cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be re-imported."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing resentment on the worm stage of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pikeover is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected organs of the state."</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" "alliance of outsiders" "as an analyst once described: two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw down the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that later he was the head of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said about his appointment to Putin:" "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends for a long time, working as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the ridicule for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">"so, is the consequence of a type of power struggle?"</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks by Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entrust arduous posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he was familiar with."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term Putin violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project should be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing of the" "ceiling blower", "which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 incline ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown accepted the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a gong for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the shutter represents future-proof high-rise and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the North Tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern train bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards in an ascent of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the tolerances on which the team works were tiny, they were only a few millimeters on each side."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments for Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"the SPD and Green Party mean: in the future, investors should be put into duty much more strongly in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next council meeting, the SPD is proposing a" "concept of action". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the SPD leader, Christoph Bratman, said:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big issue in the town hall is, however, as Bratman says:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such surfaces, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem," "Bratman:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder print runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding that, as Bratman, then a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the programme is not yet complete: for the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how can we compensate for the loss of some 1300 low-priced apartments whose support will continue in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the budgetary spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased off-running ties from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back to price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the western city, Fristen is running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There shouldn't be a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D leader Holger Herlitschke believes:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenage and child will no longer go out to play, but rather prefer spending their free time to staring on screens has been complained in the last decade of many."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to television, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go out with their smartphones to the outside and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that followed 35,000 users recently reported that within two days after launching the game, the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take 30 minutes of time to" "come from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day" "beat on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are gruelling game corruption that always has to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people hunt more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="11">Her total score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallists and "Final Five" -Mannschaftskameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="17">"it expected her last check in Brazil, a competition that wasn't so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment."</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any competition, a winning streak which will last as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture was deceptive."</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground cores - in which Biles holds the world championship title.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she again picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still one on it."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her dude - a pure formality - and tears streamed on low glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team of men, called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after their soil practising, she cast down kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>

<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will only have four turners in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks like Turns are a more expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnastics that can be maintained by parents who are responsible for training, education, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to inspire the communities of Aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and easily accessible gym training."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture makes electoral fraud bloom in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles accuses the police, election observers and city halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on grounds of" oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and local government, which is now an anti-corruption scandal, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of ballot boxes to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a reference with them in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter only needs to call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable inks to the finger of a person when they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only aimed at election fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luton Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed himself alarmed to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it reads:" "as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the older, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi backgrounds."</seg>
<seg id="21">There have been concerns that... state institutions have deliberately ignored such behavior because of "politically correct" sensitivities to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter selection papers to stop" "reaping". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social welfare purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing after your identification.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three year limit to requests for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists process full letter selections and envelopes from letter selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set off barriers to set up electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law facilitated by an indictment for intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Legislation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography ban in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, to ensure that the staff usually enforce that voters go alone in the voting cabin."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal complaint was made."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as incompatible," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "ticking controls" of the election-registration departments of the city halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke to Rhone Masrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approached from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" "move out of the shot line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker crooked before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the aggressor on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabouts for a guide his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and Würgereflex a serious test - by making some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a purge of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea of leaning the purge of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left anything he quenched, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task was definitely placed under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his test line showed a luminometric speed of more than 4,000 units."</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after its luminometric speed was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this is coming close to the worst thing I have had in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not going to dock here, because it's disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus that contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we wanted to offer consumers something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking just about the products, we wanted to put them into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" "let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked out some of the things I told him to lick up like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to teach Ian to lick them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing the added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>

<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the lessee abused to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delocation is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not suit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in short, the Kurdish municipality of Germany reckons with tens of thousands of refugees who escape from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even become" "some hundred thousand", "believes the president of the association Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurds community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective hunters from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the leader of the" "World" "leader Ali Toprak on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal charges several months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the vain putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alawite cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">So Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or distributed over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"the head of the association called for the Federal Government to be" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, there is a" witch hunt "against Erdogan critics."</seg>

<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"he who does not suit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkularians," "said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the" World. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum entitled asylum seekers in Germany before the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament already decided in the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid as so far it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and land-day ballad - that is biting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the tourists who are in the country, on the way Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count votes in the end, only to drive out laboriously."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass election campaigns over the people over it."</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say it at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newbie AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionalism.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sailors have got cold feet and chancellor Merkel gives the blame to the blooming of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you're at the right place to campaign for the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Angela Merkel is lying in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," "charged Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame to no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"so, coke, play only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also realised that in the country, its base is crumbling that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the expanses of the country hardly any."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU-sufferer Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing:" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, any birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is on the game, Sellering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats lagged behind partner CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent in front of CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of holiday hardship and largely transfer their electoral campaign into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," it calls the president Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners go to search for local stimuli under the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just goes with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and finds it also beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it will also be praised for the construction of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of shelters."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transport through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," "says the Vice President Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation project."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeps were searching and rather familiar with their navigation than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas were franking.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the community increased the vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant exaggerations," says King, who made himself a position on the spot himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been bitten.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 hours per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has passed, it has become calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue arrivals in them, everyone can look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz talks about a" "most slight decline", "but also acknowledges that" "course of course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily captured are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants were" hard hit. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have acted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, president-president Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generous is handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his host will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"other regulars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also very nice somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"according to Göhner, that his family-clientele returns to the end of the renovation work, there is no doubt about it."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history."</seg>

<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn't demand anything, which has no chances at the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas will be presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have in part: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more opportunities to incarcerate people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance, and disclose social media accounts for a safety review."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many things also seem unearthed and are open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high refugee numbers, many people worried about safety."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people deeply deal with, could not be cluttered even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved tremendously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>

<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high level between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a gartentious dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then via a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the resort chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before moving to the comment section, to clear it under the pseudonym non-Allegrename men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the redevelopment of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought a record recently are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers better keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I wear a modest gray suit in the middle of a busy street in Soho, before I stop, hold my hands and speak a bit of sentiments like:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slow in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"art from Glasgow, 55, which I got from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight men of middle-age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), revet the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that wake up happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or ownership of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee kicks off from a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record cannot own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I leafed through a stack of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle aged) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound-plate so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a pale audience, when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesize and sextpackaged pop instead of experimental jazz groaned from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but next mental trauma is hard to imagine if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes window bumps than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." "she casts off with a dearest sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I gave the impression to muster the jeans pants, I observed a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley plate player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that spends most of luxury goods such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in labs in Soho, do not consider the large number of female collectors in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the strolling through plate-stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year false presenter who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that contain a fire and sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">"moreover, they assumed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the tearing, was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp which is community-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids" Café. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that closing" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organisations" Help Refugees und L'Auberge des Migrants "estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle was up to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals in the course of the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji issued a master class in handling, side quilting, back, line run and power to win gold - her first Olympic Games of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji had defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it might be a consolation for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England of Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="9">"eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had a wonderful start and caused the attacks to bounce off GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upward, when Osea Kolinisau roared in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>

<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou stressed by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB conducted fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Sea Sulphers, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first strokes to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"there were three voices in the boat. the response of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic-old in a second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that made such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th uncompressed use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make up the difference and no one was more powerful than the coach who did not know if he was to survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term at all under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is a challenge, but it makes it even greater."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a gruesome morning talking about anything else and trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>

<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, panning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want a firework, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race we did."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from several perspectives, singing is a great hobby for seniors," says Erhard Hackler of the German seniors division. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often dissolve in age, and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and to organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly call their lungs will not get out of the puste as quickly as they do in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia sing themselves to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires special power, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's voice and a given rhythm and adjusting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially the elderly, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I do something for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"I would like to say that Livezilla is a great, yet simple chat application at an unbeateable price."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior parenchyma, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can direct themselves directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="7">"at some 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning, two explosions went up again, another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="14">"finally, some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chomphe on the south-eastern coast demanded several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings carry the same handwriting," "said Army General Danai Kritmethadee Friday morning to journalists."</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities had received secret indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - although they were not informed about the exact time and locations."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailands king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between the security forces and the Muslim population, there is no need to travel into these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, will reap the benefit of restoring the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed."</seg>

<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports of contacts of" "identity" "to AfD politicians from several German states."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maeten said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the party - in this case, is the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>

<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>

<seg id="30">This is the worrying thing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspect in attacks on asylum lodgings were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or have voted for example CDU, SPD or Left, who then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist mood."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slipped so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently used for viral interaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old completed his course with a 48-second regatta and reserved the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen run in aedics, Habte wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as the "rouble of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"referring to a" prosperity belly, "the British tabloid" The Sun "made itself funny with" Dad Bod. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he struck only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani run for media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the buoyant from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to play alone in a run over 100 metres of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a rabid calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the District Office Kulmbach found that undercover for these sewage installations."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period can be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the serious fee increases were founded by Schmidt, that in all three wastewater facilities, there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in addition, due to their age refurbishment and repair costs, in all three systems, the period in the recuperation period fell to a considerable extent."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that in the wastewater system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station Welschenkahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from the ground and the first sewage sludge had to be removed after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option was to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" these extraordinary expenses came from the required maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its Filtertool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All absenteeism gets to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and lapsed cheeks, some critics called it racist caricature of Asians -" yellowface. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injurious clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was" vulnerable "and said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was pulled into the degrading extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and appliances we all hold in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to anticipate sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and challenged others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that rapid-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices for snapshots."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left the Snapchat unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>

<seg id="1">"counterfeiting ISIS Secret service information, sets out Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual states were allowed to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Republican Committee, secret service committees and the military budget committee, reports on great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence lists who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information typically attracted by high-level CentCom commanders posted a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions were allowed on site and were more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," "a newspaper article cited the report."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leaders in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," said the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force in life after it was played, that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings that coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," proclaimed the morals among analysts and "gave excessively little space for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at CentCom analyst with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "The Daily Beast". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon's General inspector, who were taken up after complaints by CentCom analyst."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the General Inspector's investigations were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion, which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes between more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, Mr. Hooker's team noted that despite the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, the government had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with the UK is ahead"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first one will take a little longer to the strong Dutch girl who will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket (her two older sisters played the sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backstroke from the near-range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"without victory in the tournament India had gone into the game, but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" "said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the middle of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the wristband protection to the swimmer to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a women's flock with dimples, could have been well known under these famous names, which were sent to the Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV commercials, if he was a float, gymnast or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many people I asked didn't know that it was an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 has had an athlete who has made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider's charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling motions (turning, pike and ointages) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to version, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in her quest for gold, medallists must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also in the broadcasts a further heightened goal: the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful ambition is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a respite."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolf into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympics-mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the angling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the United States "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid alliance of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">"according to Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options apart from protesting, it breaks out," "said Sejm Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogades, which have been defeated more or less in recent years, will avail of turmoil and re-arm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so hardest to get together.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, who come from aedics predominantly Christian high-countries, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amresa and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which constitute about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Northern Ethiopian region from the Tigray region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which, according to the statements of analysts, were apparently fueled by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal envy of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters arrested in Gondar, an official city, managed by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflug over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently announced that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin grate hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by anging that his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who try to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position, to explain statements he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump went back to the assertion on Thursday and insisted on insisting that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rattled to Mr. Trump while he was trying to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation falling down due to falling commodities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton chatted to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump was trying to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared" Of course, I said the sarcastic. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "according to how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone as his cargo values have continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while reinforcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherzes brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it rear-broker, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on any of his words and being preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he moaned the poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!" "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COs last book" "Chop Suey" "was about Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick was told in her book" "97 Orchard" "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag shows the history of American cuisine during Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small local snack at Flatiron District, which has been in store since the crash crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable soup ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter asked Hackett, this found the pair suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Brickman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cheese and bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women boiled for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the paths with which the country was dealing with it no longer to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods that recycle the casserole as a" "wonderful way of residing food leftovers", "Brickman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixtures have been tried, since a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy dishes."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes prescriptions, Brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at midday," "says Coe."</seg>
<seg id="29">"brickman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland hai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks get offspring only with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a rich 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal" "Science" "at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" madness, "Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, comments this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist long ago assumed that Greenland-haie will become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-penteives measured it when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt down sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver that torches from higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues therefore examined 28 Greenland Houses that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably lots of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth was supposed to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempt to tow large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens nucleus emits a small excess of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th anniversary in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland-arks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimetres should be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year old harpoon tip was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flaming flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a blatant contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and reporters in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obligated by law to do so."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have declared a tax inspection by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day hike from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were met."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in the past two years, the Secretary General of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and we finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, the open gate of mercy on Freiburg Minster was a special pilgrim's destination."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruene, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern was on their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim's crosses and parted the pilgrim's blessing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Muenster Unserer loved woman, and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and lyrics in the morning and evening."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on field crossings, chapels and churches again and again went to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parishes of the local parishes were provided."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"on top of that, one stepped down the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of distance, but had to recover some 500 metres of altitude in the case of swollen heat and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy."</seg>

<seg id="19">"in the evening mass in Münster, the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert, who arrived at the pilgrimage destination, were welcomed."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottland Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy made himself Eigen. the JP made the legend haughty when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who were victorious four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner placed an Olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard round the New Zealand won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder was back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation that drove in a higher course to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has been won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form Kenny, it's possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and murder charges as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to lifting the energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby repealing all supply contracts, such as supplying energy companies."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision at Victoria beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melt refining consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the long-standing speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that three further owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt", "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL informed that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual drop of $187 million in" "anticipation of cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "Ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt" "or" "guarantee the power supply to the melt". ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation of why it has withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analyst statements at the beginning of the week, the head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator that wouldn't be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managress and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan are on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "Kendall wrote."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping-up with the Kardashians similar?), a frivolous reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché story almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you? "with the honesty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that rather resembles an image tape as a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the unveiling of his coverstars is so eagerly awaited, that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leak before the official announcement."</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there have been clearly more celebrities that are modeled as" models, the celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of its generation - is under the former category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or youths from today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success does not suit everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them "the misty of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings re-cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying down on the Mississippi seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator arrived on the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not well in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather bulky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came to business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, Communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover, Germany, as an" office in western pocket format. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"indeed, the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit distressing slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in August 1996, no one could suspect that Communicator would be the beginning of the smart phone era."</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster that was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today controls suppliers that all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, that is today for a lot of people's everyday lives."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local authorities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we operated a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>

<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" "in an act of despair" "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police told them as well as every witness of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter said to Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, dyed atmosphere, and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day-side-side of the sun for almost two months," "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable once, Venus -- over several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus, which as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve around different rates in starches, as well as in what connection the rotational periods with planetary creation are."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotation rates, these mature stars repel large amounts of starches."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars rotting pirouettes than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," "said Rebull."</seg>

<seg id="2">The programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the culprits specialize their blackmail software to attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to extored ransom is considerably higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently seeing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most paint programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Bitcoin cryptogram."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is injected."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of sales by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business operation completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"several hospitals in Germany have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims:" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators" demand in the face of a standstill in operation. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a sort of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, create freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are saved by a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five digits in order to get back their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a Ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the present malware Kits were created by the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>

<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set from a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per certified computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is well-known for many companies that secure their data better."</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey place their trust in preventing ransomware through file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful replacement, the offenders threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price escalations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators will also be able to set new targets on the internet of things in the future."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat that was connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the offenders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any point."</seg>

<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-speed and 1026 l with reversed backrests, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>

<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded very well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he should do his work slightly more quietly, though."</seg>
<seg id="13">The consumption of daily consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttle the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and HDMI ports lie beneath the armrest and are therefore slightly cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep anymore."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders speak?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, so an inhalation and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just falling asleep many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association in Varel in Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there are organic, psychological or behavioural factors behind it, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">"not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in depression," "says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a disk failure can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to salute about everyday problems and worries, Weeß will give an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month or at least three nights a week, you should go to the doctor, tell us."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look very different: one is beaten down, tired, tired, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classical bedtime tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is little to be left in Germany, emphasised Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should contact your GP when you sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with examinations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, if you are unable to find the cause of a sleep disturbance, the medical officer will advise you in case of snoring with respiratory problems, with sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a breakdown disorder."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just make no nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the dressing you go to bed at your normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping room."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which you can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeß will count on: regular sleeping and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and at night not watch at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few Lindenbrooks, in between still some rest cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem so at first sight, but the police count them among the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"going along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bike trail."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly" has jumped to the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, articles about this" trendy district, "as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, are preferentially illustrated with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason for this is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as the" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners were rebuilding the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers pulled away under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertained before late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who prefers three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the home projects, they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wished to make a majority of police protection against the vandaliating left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between occupiers and their neighbours, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"unlike the rest of the city, Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was a traditional working-class quarter, which also has a lower average and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under great police custody in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalised in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and suffberers from all over the world: residents of GDR times and former domestic squads now share their neighborhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in discarded disks or freshly painted facades thrown with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned this year together with the words" "Autonomous Violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes do not constitute damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer there in the Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously moved into the Rīga Strait - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly demanded German sovereignty over the borough in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well cared for here are living here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not see violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for those who annoyed themselves about color bombs, Kerstin has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="38">"who pulls out should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district, who can complain poorly on noise."</seg>

<seg id="6">"it sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine's customer from the working circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deulechle is there, the unsolved Wollmilchsau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought after."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes, as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50% job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuchle supports honest and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time now, a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must bring the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Land Council to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work, so it is necessary to rely on private apartments, such as Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community dwellings need to be disheartened, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuchle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and employment for refugees and migrants who have to be undone or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the construction yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuchle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuchle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and honorary officials jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and can make them useful for the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, too, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "therefore, the work of Deuchle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two of the most recent incidents fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine's customer quite clearly, "some naive may call." a residual risk can and should not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins brought them completely into oblivion.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials must look for jobs on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to place them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would unwind the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine's customer also makes clear that the Urbacher, too, has already been utilized to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
