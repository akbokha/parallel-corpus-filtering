Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also meant to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; with the deal raised by Obama about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb commented with a somewhat supp@@ ressed voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ l and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already completed 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call one day after .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ l died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers included 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some incl@@ ines to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problems .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he had nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b &apos;s track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and educated geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ l , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ l when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer carnival three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ l was a nurse working for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ l Night at night 5 September last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica playing finish before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his brother and student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation took part in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the University choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ l called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it will not be so many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies prepare themselves to employ time workers to equip shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox comments his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated body and an arm @-@ length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief demands again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; ban called for the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at p@@ olls down@@ wards , it doesn &apos;t work yet . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one was able to win only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps Any popularity has turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ p@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; angry &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans see Tru@@ mp Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ p@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their schol@@ arly hats , Republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp is real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l from the past week , four out of ten believe that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er Tru@@ mps campaign can be seen as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still beats almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp leadership while the anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot;
&quot; ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before margin Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have firmly given their votes .
&quot; of course , a lot can be done to change that , and no one can really say changing the mind . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp has been calling immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing point was in public discourse about 2016 . &quot;
&quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold decisive Hez@@ ek@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party , and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l on Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will seem to do it . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new levels .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also mad at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated over the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent dis@@ satisfied and 21 percent &quot; &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the 5 most exclusive residential buildings in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , one of the prices comes just like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ er@@ prizes in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , with a good mind . &quot;
but well who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich lies here as an exception not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ ra@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern in the Wit@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth launch of the series is to be the first step towards fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to win the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received a good help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who was allowed to pass a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm , before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium ahead of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without glit@@ tering .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent six home games in the top class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bra@@ vely , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were introduced too often by reloc@@ ation to left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely penet@@ rated against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k crashed out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by direct debit the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put a needle @-@ stick . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was allowed to leave .
&quot; for example , when he directed a shot of ideas about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing training , &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer , &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the defeated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put on it . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans had provoked the fans of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and started to strike against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern enthusi@@ ast was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this is a long @-@ term study close to Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; the good news : in the event of ren@@ unciation , the risk is rapidly dropping . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and tooth loss is due to frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the danger again falls to the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health to high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study emphasizes the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists rep@@ el lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is constantly being consul@@ ted as a specialist for archae@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman of goods train captured
&quot; after a young woman at the station has moved to the station in Gei@@ ers@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the railway track and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by capturing the train , she suffered serious injuries from the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated in a hospital emergency and was brought to a hospital by the rescue staff .
there is no knowledge about the reason of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman .
the incident was possibly witnessed by witnesses or residents heard acoustic perceptions .
&quot; there are residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ strasse , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function reflects much more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that can trust citizens , &quot; &quot; explained the commission@@ er of the European commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de ahead of introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is supposed to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings take concrete action that the EU states and the United States have jointly chosen independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties agreed to each other on the refer@@ ee , and there was no objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings requested above all are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , on which firms can lead damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ elling national laws , or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act provided inadequate proposals for the European Commission . &quot;
critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig , ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the business pi@@ voting possibilities by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club in Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting fol@@ ks@@ crew recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pin . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of different places , which he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
where they came from and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that harmon@@ i@@ ously blend very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift in great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a promising series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ gau , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
out@@ going ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs have long gone out , the stage shows here are a colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage ko . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and it is possible that the &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; can be thrown away . &quot;
&quot; only for an en@@ core thanks to St@@ ev@@ ens modest , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been anticipated with suspen@@ se at the prime minister &apos;s survey . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questions and to invest with David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch . his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain in silence during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain at a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , is at the heart of several newspaper pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News Night program , he advised the Labour Chair to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported it as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within the Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes put forward in order to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds altogether .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade against the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy set , says he has &quot; &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the ru@@ ff@@ ling of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has to refrain from &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ perc@@ ussions and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also made the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; P@@ unch of Ju@@ dy &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s inquiry . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and op@@ press far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases through accelerated growth in the UK
&quot; the pound grew br@@ ittle according to data indicating an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the SA@@ B@@ Miller building target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period in the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and achieved assessments on the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
&quot; the pound climbed by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % from the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index topped with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher than encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares climbed 5 % after the mining giant said he took $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the Mon@@ di packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put in his assessment of the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports advertising company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber in the Capital : on Bi@@ eber Expedition in Berlin

the type with plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million Euros .
more even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the Generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the Bi@@ eber @-@ Bau : here , her i@@ dol , whose posters hang on in St@@ et@@ tin , have been living since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much the day as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in half a year . &quot;
if ever .
&quot; he says , &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans are not .
also Bi@@ eber itself does not .
that has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super@@ star , he invested three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ pi@@ p@@ id company pur@@ ged many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber is also cas@@ c@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you &apos;re amazed at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say hyp@@ e g@@ ossi@@ p too far .
&quot; others stress that , finally , in the United States and the United Kingdom , Bi@@ eber is in number 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he saw on television by chance . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , there is a barbecue grill , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been submitted to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay is therefore not willing to give away . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary understanding also comes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts action campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - inv@@ a@@ sions
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through mainstream media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investor @-@ strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost met@@ a $ 13 million before interest and tax , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programs to El@@ an will rise , and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis board Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was ra@@ ced by the in@@ famous confrontation of Cy@@ rene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f s@@ worn out a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was def@@ tly defended . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am more demanding is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the conflict , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he continues to fit into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he gets tough , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Cy@@ rene in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and sm@@ ashed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Ser@@ b officials with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the Migran@@ ts &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nation @-@ bloc with a meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not insist on a bal@@ eful action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprisonment in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are thereby quickly re@@ pairing the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the Pres@@ i@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders posted some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders can only be back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit among democratic voters under the age of 50 has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton when nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly excited about her .
the views are mixed more strongly with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den does not decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge ahead S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate of prim@@ aries is considered unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results on some key features in choosing their party &apos;s prim@@ aries .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since there are questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their overall opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has worsen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters overall : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights see also Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than frank@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , the two candidates have now lost half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose their support dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tur@@ b@@ mp in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - he lands 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent ABC News / Washington Post pol@@ l showed also Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday , during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers is enough to find warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a fatal ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with related eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal through a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and put the welfare of the br@@ otherhood on the part of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs again with bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; frat@@ ernity and its members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the br@@ otherhood , and the national frat@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the land@@ se is going to drop , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the time needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal levels , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is an historic trend @-@ based view on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase enters , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to be seas@@ oned for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , which published Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strate@@ gi@@ sts at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occur in the increase cycle and the return will start to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in an increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; all the year , market participants were prepared for an increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to present have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in net interest and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the loans return immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse because an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet exceed 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for its &quot; sil@@ encing &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial rivals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private parties do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously called examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work was needed to engage the audience when it did this in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial rivals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in special BBC mode .
he added that he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house cow@@ shed &quot; when the next time we start a series of entertainment .
&quot; however , he refused to include the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the commission ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales were slow@@ ing down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed its expendi@@ tures in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping mall has bored , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that the online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ itting itself , and we may experience that growth will be less@@ ened . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers increased to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
&quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that , out of £ 5 , a little more than 1 £ was spent online . &quot;
&quot; for some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial places in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia det@@ aches the collapse of some of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed , &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed , who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; filled , mostly dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead appeared their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ on@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators killed , when a crane fell through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca , with thousands who will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane would not have been abandoned when it was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was banned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man lied to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the p@@ addle , which will take place later this month , were gathered . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree did not rebu@@ ke the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a sever@@ ed son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
&quot; government officials stipul@@ ated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other criminals will receive half of this amount .

&quot; the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women to deal with B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this to a balance more strongly .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of decisions about buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British leader in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues after the Group inde@@ xed the costs of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new stores . &quot;
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob for un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of being abuse of office .
he has been convic@@ ted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , it cryst@@ alli@@ zed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the accused used funds from club accounts to which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions and used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial terms .
&quot; this fact retired the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; in the event of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that no part of the association was created at any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would have only charged allowance damage and the sports club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession , told the financial officer . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have fired up money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debts must be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of corresponding financial success , reimbur@@ sement of expenses compens@@ ates retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance damage was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the events . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als had not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in the details of the financial burden , important was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against which a functional investigation began for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that was the case , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and according to his statement , the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot;
this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; indem@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; why indem@@ n@@ ity ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1,000 euros per month at diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were unable to present precise documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept in store after an operation examination , in which everything had been judged correctly . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also referred to as the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the adjustments are made in cash , so he said in his statement from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing was continued on 23 September with a survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard orders more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to staff cuts running for the past three years , the computer giant will disman@@ tle further jobs when the company spl@@ its up . &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ Computer terri@@ fic He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the 5@@ 5.000 jobs , which have been running for three years , have not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the corporation , which is grown with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a again dis@@ appointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers based on its services , were the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer in the world . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and do more and more businesses online . &quot;
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total of about 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mainly come down to rejection : 54 percent said against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other countries fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; however , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 percent were unable to decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility until September 27th . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the organisers of the Auto @-@ Verband ( V@@ DA ) anticipate some 900@@ ,000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water ej@@ ectors against several hundred displaced persons .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind the police , there was a police line forming and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water thro@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles . &quot;
the officials initially put in un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ mint spray .
afterwards the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees put together and suffered under the short@@ ness of breath .
the police spokesman of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time to decide on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half of the opinion that the F@@ ed was going to do , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer , and the interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent will be retained . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; make it happen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot a man , and one was killed . &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller on his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ l , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to undo it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he had nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ l had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is no information , no evidence for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ l was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ l had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ l was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ l worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ l . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ l , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought for leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large corporate structure .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the Group conversion to the workplace .
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa Group is expanding its corporate structure and util@@ ises the low @-@ budget Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to provide a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings budget should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the Tari@@ ff conflict with the Pilot @-@ Clean cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the court @-@ made strike . &quot;
this shared the union with .
the topic of the talks should be the final resting place for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit wishes to come with a projected record result &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible to achieve sustainable results . &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and the airline in recent months led to various strikes .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa has moved to the Group &apos;s own cheap Euro@@ wings budget line . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought the left outer defender to weeping and will exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a mo@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched it &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , gives instead a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; reads . &quot;
&quot; as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a young named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is willing to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment , due to the prot@@ rac@@ ted , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ ought kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street speaker said the text probably had come from Cameron &apos;s election cycle office .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff but gave no further immediate comments .
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still difficult &quot;
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown asset on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves England &apos;s test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; of course , the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he gets further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first put Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer I highly appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and received four squ@@ ads , appeared and I don &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een does not have his job done for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns at once and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cu@@ bi@@ cle , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; the team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have any problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ completed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was viol@@ ently tram@@ pled on Tuesday for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , the UK itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive amendments that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants a great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened with the over@@ power@@ ing long endurance athletes such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading power .
&quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better in order to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; so perhaps some such ministers may intentionally not plan any useful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ unists , who made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone ch@@ opping foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ nation@@ als who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you &apos;re sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems at risk of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it very friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ dom can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s years when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ &apos;s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and depu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the clou@@ dy bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ wing dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities relating to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power on which I was reminded of something similar to the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined themselves by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; base report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criterion decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he was also part of the session . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he , that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers of tobacco comparison . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in an illness with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear proof of recent evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should abandon East@@ En@@ ders , says former leader of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for their public @-@ legal programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and stations like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC &apos;s programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least rely on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time frame because they want to reach as wide support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame in the hunt for reviews because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows will be what the former Head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , that BBC shows should sell like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure rather the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue when they are on their apparent missions to justify four billion dollars of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think everyone , we all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and enter@@ prising in the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and deal with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances in order to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
&quot; scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves . &quot;
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
pul@@ ses work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of men to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when turning ultras@@ on@@ ically onto the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ wers and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ h@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pulse of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; important announcement : drive from 15th to 18th September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the trade fair - through a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and wi@@ el@@ dy company advertising , but &quot; through the in@@ lays with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ vat@@ ting : people tell wh@@ ence you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ore , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you do not love to hate or hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wash their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll @-@ culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student of soci@@ ability is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
kno@@ cking kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ ek .
&quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have made you something . so , and now please smile when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually might associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you tap . &quot;
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chickens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced approach than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if there was something to make Drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded to this with even more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbors asleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally enter the same residence hall ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you &apos;re a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her again , separate herself and see her every day and maybe experience how she is taking all the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ belly a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ les your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ ten@@ ders , t@@ anning servic@@ ers &quot;
real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; that is , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build a good and cheap way today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly a cheap living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great deal here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each with four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ ance Dec@@ ree .
have a look at the picture .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even everyday people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor . &quot;
I show how to build today still cheap and good .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , since they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update on iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the sli@@ mming of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located close to a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , since the phone could switch half way and this could lead to a dis@@ continuation of the update . &quot;

N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup second emphasized in front of the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ time champion Hamilton .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot muster the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have gathered under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; besides consultations , one can also take part in courses there . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; from now on , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for many years now , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently , many services of the insur@@ ers are not claimed , because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new hous@@ eholder Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; apart from consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) emphas@@ ised at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang , 92 years old &quot;
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of the Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday . &quot;
with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus will lose an honorary member and at the same time one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute leader . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg Palace and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he intends to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he did not intellectu@@ ally commit himself intellectu@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; in the inner city of Bre@@ mer , Wiese was just cutting his hair when he saw how outside a guard @-@ guard issued a bal@@ lot for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese was stor@@ med by the business , insul@@ ted the official and threw down the fine fin@@ es in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual occurrence . &quot;
&quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only then will it be decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the area of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young people , and struck the face with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends r@@ ushed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove past demonstrations several times .
&quot; when one no longer saw the vehicle , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was re@@ ass@@ aul@@ ted by the bat and another male person .
&quot; in the aid of a stroke , one re@@ ass@@ ures the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; up to now , there is only a v@@ ague description of the day . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in height .
the second ra@@ cket is about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and critics to sign up under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left to right ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller will open the practice again on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first sight when the ri@@ ms of the field met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their professional training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ins would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
&quot; in the meantime , however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from 19 September onwards , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen works as a primary doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is given by the Müll@@ ers within the framework of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the seed community ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; said vel@@ vet mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2,000 patients come to Fel@@ ce@@ ausen every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , inci@@ dentally also looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen recalls . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly she felt after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; says the student . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds , laughing , &quot; &quot; We have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair likes two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border stay in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for a asylum application can do so &quot; naturally . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear also that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia with@@ stands &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to move incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and possibly er@@ ect corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister for Home Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia wants to avoid barriers to refugees . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Mr Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried for Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it deals mainly with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country expects about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was a way of suggest@@ ing certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should travel here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
thus it could indeed come to a somewhat further west stretch of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country , in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptions . &quot;
&quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , appe@@ aled to calm Wednesday early at a local presence in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not currently be about very high numbers of refugees .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime , which is accused of having gained insights into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case lasted .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sun shine and middle of four big panels each with the heading &quot; Bev@@ or I die I want .... &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce subsi@@ ded with this action on its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions .
&quot; while a Pass@@ ant spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and reads the phrase &quot; my life affir@@ med , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , little discussion about the action in itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that some@@ day the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effectiveness action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets is understandable , but finally , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open themselves . &quot;

&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was sought by volunteers by the call of honour , she immediately reported and was there with the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ li@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her job and the experiences and experiences made here .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings bl@@ ended , financial outlook for 2016 lowered &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wishes to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told us to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view , despite the price increases , will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and , despite higher rates for bo@@ d@@ ging transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; the company yields solid yields if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for summer holidays were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks surv@@ eyed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net transport sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues because of higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; there is a mur@@ al of the United States , im@@ pending upon them at the end of the orn@@ ate two @-@ storey meeting hall . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets may frigh@@ ten the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which is uns@@ ett@@ ling in itself to the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in net interest this week .
&quot; however , financial markets are expecting to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decrease in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed Policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that she did not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in net interest would ease financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sha@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would threaten global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a bit this month , and the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences complex calculation when interest should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would wear the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the implications for the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former director , Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , a co @-@ ordin@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to raise interest rates , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the United States , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis such as the 2008 brand uph@@ eav@@ al , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate statement . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried produce , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and cro@@ ckery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the coff@@ ers and has various pick @-@ up options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as does the fish @-@ counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even roast on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop is part of the massive freezing department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and g@@ all , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef and g@@ all , pork , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commerci@@ ally prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not hard to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Help for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , is not without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a body and soul teacher .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , that &apos;s quite another lesson than at a real school . &quot;
Brazilian Pon@@ di@@ at@@ rical Society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nour@@ ishment for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ rical organization SP@@ RS is trying to explain how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck at breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Bern@@ ried community approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turnkey construction on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ center step forward step by step : in the latest joint meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the committee had already decided to apply an application to a statutory &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ es first and roof over@@ lay &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again the til@@ ting of the roof , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan - was to lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; therefore , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan has no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to the til@@ ting of the roof . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym @-@ building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport promotion .
&quot; in the next stage of the process , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ high hall will now be presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the Land@@ rä@@ tin , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the Board of Directors will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases inside the centre .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree that both houses lead , until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed defini@@ tively in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district planned this for 2018 , if the currently ongoing renovation was completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the House which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß couldn &apos;t say there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry are lod@@ ged there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 h ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the ranking leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the past season , the ba@@ thers at Bh@@ c had a painful defeat and got something to do there . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ ov with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the Aber@@ n@@ garten on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Witt@@ enberg County ) several hunters were in use , as the police told . &quot;
&quot; after a firing , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; at first , it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident . &quot;
the C@@ ID has been identified .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds who have been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed teenagers and cast their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old who has been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; an alleged 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also deemed to be suspect on Tuesday evening , who , according to the fact , admitted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after having not arrived at home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the group of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old finally revealed himself . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported to the authorities in police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be kept on Wednesday at the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put a sla@@ b to him . &quot;
conclusions about the immediate circumstances of the deed are to bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid ble@@ ach .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long ago begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; to compare : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have stayed for rent in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only on the rise in refugees . &quot;
the study also provides significant om@@ is@@ sions in the residential construction policy of recent years .
&quot; as a result , Germany has a flat deficit that is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there have already been some 77@@ 0.000 living units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities and shared flat @-@ rooms .
&quot; because of the noise on the housing market , young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; for longer . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments is limited . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are needed according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been obtained on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million . &quot;
now the project could be even increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; the route , however , is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the eradic@@ ation of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have left Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make virtually unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences . &quot;
the border strip contains other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; however , after the shut@@ down of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 challenged people . &quot;
shortly before the end of the Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law stages the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 pen@@ alties were therefore initiated . &quot;
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
there are 13 families with small children and two older people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped there .
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
the barrier mesh has been disman@@ tled and one of the recep@@ tions in the border area has been re@@ mod@@ elled .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood by travel buyers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein end , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once su@@ ck@@ led , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N meeting . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Passa@@ u , and after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to reach the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was placed at the Inn in front of the border at W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ leg course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of supporting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly supported the position of the Hungarian government in the ha@@ ze of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; praised land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quarters &quot;
&quot; with the submission of refugees , Konrad himself took all his hands fully . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad was already under control of the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen refugee centre .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot;
&quot; the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also carried out without a big whi@@ rl@@ wind , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Konrad calcul@@ ates a total of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial cent@@ uri@@ ons .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the next refugees , to create lod@@ gings . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to explain how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator &quot; &quot; also sets great expectations for the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can offer simple accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that quot@@ as must comply with a certain amount of towel holders or size of the duties . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must be valid . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad is based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to bear any costs , as they declared themselves . &quot;
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
&quot; until now , the search for own lod@@ gings has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with approval . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can be subject to these measures at the moment , &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the City Council in the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a prolonged telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has made further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria is now also introducing controls on its borders , &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T to the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : finally , she has now grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la Shop opposite the store , where she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
a couple of weeks ago it was rebuilt .
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women wear a hand@@ bag in the sight of a hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last safety . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s up to you that a nice bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot;
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always a good one .
&quot; whether it is xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office ga@@ thers the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen C@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker finds a term for many in the wine village of Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to whom besides Tru@@ mp the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , I also think that &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather went out and opened a tavern for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
first real estate acquisitions in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate company .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once had been cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
it had repeatedly discussed Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as it is pol@@ ed , this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of the city of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension host Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had Sa@@ y at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for whom Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as protective area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show . &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s evalu@@ ations . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers because sunrise had an average 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today &apos;s today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to the Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today , Today , Today , the average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , Sun@@ rise faces an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these da@@ w@@ men more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood finishes his lips tightly to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have decided in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and they named his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods final rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the game corruption who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and saw ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as pairs .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next chance to a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordin@@ ators Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne resem@@ bled the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin Debut in 2007 when a passport came to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee numbers , the Free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis in Bay@@ erns &apos;s schools when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the country &apos;s Sunday survey conven@@ es Friday to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
&quot; actually , other major topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now dominates the Free elec@@ torate .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as it gave them during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Liber@@ al vot@@ er . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters away as soon as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised the fact that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need unified nationwide standards for federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy should not fall under the table in the city of Groß@@ wall@@ stadt . &quot;
years of permanent bur@@ ners are on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Middle @-@ level plus , &quot; in which an extension of the upper secondary school was tested for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
festive Wall Street helps Da@@ x on jumps
&quot; the German stock market has closed , after a long @-@ term , trend @-@ free and nervous process of trading . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a firm pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized score won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted some 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
&quot; many stock exchanges reck@@ on that markets up to the interest rate in the United States , and even the major decline in the exchange rates , will take place on this Friday . &quot;
the discussion surrounding the burdens arising from the nuclear ph@@ asing has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E on a record low and left deep marks on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the Da@@ x peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;

investment in promising waf@@ er technology and the focus on the car market should be paid out .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were cut off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA did at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW reached 1.@@ 34 percent or 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .

&quot; in the afternoon , the euro &apos;s course decreased to EUR 1,@@ 12@@ 62 . &quot;

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday said . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ers say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
&quot; at present , the city is preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meters . &quot;
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
which investor has come into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and the building which is located on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor has made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ gli@@ ders are further concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure facilities .
&quot; for months , the doors behind closed doors were negotiated , ting@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are lying on the table .
&quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening at the Em@@ press &apos;s municipal development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which proposed to investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Se@@ hr@@ enbach went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ ds who came to the meeting arous@@ ed the images and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , compla@@ ins of the representation of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z , that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , as a number of other project critics , he fears that the transport through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : &quot; there must be whole bus@@ loads , so that it pays off , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches promotional campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / quarters were doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for obes@@ e diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c con@@ ges@@ tion - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and 28 % in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to this , the diabetes was completely reduced only by one percent , and in some cases with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased A@@ 1@@ c level from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also reported average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas @-@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is lying with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently taking notice in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama sang Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the road to the solution of this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this provoked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; toxic control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who so@@ ck strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 were reported to report the toxic control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children could visi@@ bly drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry to the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legal in an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teachers by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
&quot; the police considered the sh@@ attered plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and directed disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not just about returning the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted Celtic fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , now with five points promin@@ ently at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel that exactly so - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better .
now stand together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January @-@ transfers

&quot; the former chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; the players who come in summer have this season @-@ time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by placing unnecessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising overall .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland was 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the rate of employment for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I witnessed an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day moved closer , I began to fear myself . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see backgrounds in the US , and since there are often more applications available than places available , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying unnecessary death .
persu@@ ade her to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the Police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cobal@@ t t@@ amp@@ on sample at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; &quot; see how too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
but I have arrived at the point I don &apos;t care about and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination near Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; throw out his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday all the day that was so .
but it was also the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and pad@@ dock in Cob@@ ram on the weekend .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 @-@ year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and sub@@ missi@@ veness and other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beat back against rivals because of alle@@ gations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as the &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team is confident that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; this time again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring games when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ oma a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny as this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his play on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a mess . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks doing and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means we are still going to meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final finale in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who could potentially have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ mes of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the mor@@ nings and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ consuming punishment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escap@@ ing Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , is reported to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left in the last moment , as the police told . &quot;
the accident @-@ causing driver &apos;s cab has been torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through and found the bewil@@ dering news and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and then he preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the editions , and did not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since it can be argued that &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; is to be found in its off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ g@@ users left the people out of fear of discovery and arrest more and more on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the county of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had come to the German side by foot over bridges and du@@ st@@ les .
&quot; there , they are taken in reception by federal police and forwarded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Munich Main Station significantly increased the number of refugees , compared to the week of the week . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people were in the capital &apos;s capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , informed the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has gone from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with goats from 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , there is mainly a movement for the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August , this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is launching an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines can be counted for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the major competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is to be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA : new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he comes to the trade , then also as a station wagon . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is quite new in the segment .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put their hand in front of the front : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were equipped . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the fresh@@ ened Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Enfor@@ cement Institute Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
this was the decision made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , had now been on free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his official position due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges lifted up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
Kammer@@ gericht now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of prison term for compensation was decisive , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ ise of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; thus they first spoke of a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was locked naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to human dignity , a decision of 2011 is also the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel incident in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the then plain@@ ti@@ ff stayed for over three months , between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore trapped again and again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even in ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the statement of vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated commitment in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we are creating that .
what is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing is out of the rental price bond , and in order to find these particularly favorable homes , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be created each year , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany are not asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , writes Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; it is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political change according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residence duty , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view prevailed in a majority of ways that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the root parents , it is only once more important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ da@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes leaflets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators is to rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for the lessons . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ case from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has abandoned his attitude . &quot;
student @-@ willing refugees may be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a re@@ payment or toler@@ ation do not receive performances according to the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to leg@@ is@@ lators . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years until now , in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g from January 1 , 2016 this gap is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must be closed , asking Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; in future , Islam will play an important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually rec@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church law to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally , would also be important . &quot;
duties are also part of the rights .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant them certain controls . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to prosec@@ ute such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will need to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a decade . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored by the police and authorities . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German demand long and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the coming years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , writes Professor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all newcom@@ ers to receive health cards immediately . &quot;
services provided could later be settled by the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut as many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over by them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have been helped with more general medical points of contact in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; there is much more un@@ attended disability among refugee children , and it is about HIV education among young people . &quot;
&quot; but with the partially different disease pictures , German doctors come from her education , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as for the doctor &apos;s don@@ ki , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved of relief . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass ex@@ ams again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Flas@@ h@@ backs &quot; &quot; with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and death fears . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances , strong sho@@ cking and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees get psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on a brick @-@ based v@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the family thus lies in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into another world for two hours , &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to be able to take up the Cuban duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and jo@@ int@@ iness . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
snake humans fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often a topic among various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes up his position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each mat@@ ing unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are named aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , something should be part of it . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , desc@@ ended from a podium in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with bu@@ ckets . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ sted it and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , who warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity in parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is concerned about the dangers of politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says a company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage you have called &quot; the Si@@ licon Valley &apos;s birth@@ place . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss out at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the European Championship will surely be uncertain . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this type of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , who have recorded most vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability ratio continues during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have an extra time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has pulled the lessons from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven away from the far @-@ away hope of leading the association to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out in arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ tification ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign Against a miserable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms observed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication managed through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case even though they often with@@ hold themselves to completely explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone service , I explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term management mechanisms .
she presents clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the backdrop to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , to break Malm@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they do not only aim for the qualifying for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class ticket of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . later he was replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could last weekend a 2 : 2 Draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over from Manchester United in the last month before joining Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a Play @-@ off to reach this stage , played with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he played his fellow players , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this finished all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
&quot; the Swiss resident mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by inc@@ ur@@ ring raw material prices , gathered $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of his huge debt settlement plan . &quot;
&quot; the London registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion , in order to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodities prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale last week , as part of the more extensive plans to wipe out around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion stocks worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in this evening , the U.S. President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have aired bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President X@@ is &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington , before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ es@@ pi@@ onage in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion League winner , two times champion League winner , two times champion League , once World Champion - the Tit@@ le List of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was before the European Championship before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; trunk @-@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not happen .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .

who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film@@ making
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a episode of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke down when this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian fes@@ tiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production team Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ l brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down on the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o . Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are coming at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to apply discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album sil@@ ently , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports climbing and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was to climb a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the big prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; managing director K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he got some gru@@ dge about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he got crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers cre@@ ep past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins wa@@ ved a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; he has done well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks achieved a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy crossed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run , Ver@@ hagen put the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders st@@ ach S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled out of the game by the injury list after he lack@@ ed more than one month for a back rest .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ ked gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game creating a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not strike very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , no points scored in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns on six hits and one walk with four strokes . &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of an injury to the limbs .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the injury list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he was missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it shall then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it estimated 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ische provincial capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily suspended .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to information provided by the president responsible for the first shot . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; collective views &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive stock@@ pil@@ ing of international assistance to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , to Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , sent no refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt to distribute more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee success in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial recording and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; under@@ line Merkel , those people who would need protection , complain this too . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ view cannot stay in Germany either .
this conception was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania had to be sealed with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking pas@@ sports across Romania and Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new limit fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice cream of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ aps . &quot;
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its path around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this exchange movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanent body of cel@@ esti@@ al bodies , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal I@@ car@@ us .
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed . &quot;
&quot; the extension of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing several weeks in 1860
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
a study conducted by the 27 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ duc@@ tor viol@@ ated the association .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich @-@ based Li@@ ons , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ nia of loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the Six@@ ties presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training after his bra@@ ins shake .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National Player should enter the running training . &quot;
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent collision at the head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to take care of his slender line will often get dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them , B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. primarily contain man@@ gos , but much vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor Beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone does not tell anything about the ripe fruit , so green man@@ gos can also taste delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet dishes .
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney adap@@ ts well to fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US package service U@@ PS provides up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company already started to recru@@ it seasonal workers , announced U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 hil@@ es for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the parcel service harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn breaks in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the gro@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; after gro@@ oming on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn wind blows from 60 to 100 km / h on Thursday morning , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate occasionally to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the mountain slope begins to st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; here , rain sets in , that lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 litres of rainf@@ all per square meter must be expected , which after the last few days , huge rainf@@ alls have already fallen . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the blow f@@ öhn winds its way through a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind dri@@ es up strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back clearly . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , on Wednesday , a previously un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) presented himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a rotten sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
then Luther initiated the spl@@ itting of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus , with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns , is one of the masterpieces by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated the Bible text .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with glorious images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles which dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or father@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into &quot; &quot; Today , in Current Issu@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original scrip@@ tw@@ elling of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry box has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; the education was already done with the cane stock , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to get art more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by advertisements , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , &quot; discover them , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art have been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chosen the most important and mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
&quot; plans made , place found , company engaged , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured destruction , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
so hill deported to new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first municipal manager Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; other memorial break &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its engagement for refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga faces a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can tell in principle that this doesn &apos;t concern me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for each individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football and wool can help .
but the decisive course has to face politics .
&quot; the German Football Federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal agencies also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will take the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can be , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot;
&quot; we can use football teams , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government , the association will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up all the money for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : Chief Executive Officer of the SAP board loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , after midnight he fell on a glass of water , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged him out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you have fallen .

&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; leaving R@@ eus again on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his el@@ event@@ h position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of gene@@ alo@@ gical novel bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les was open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by Mit@@ tee R@@ eus , that the final suit for B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is understandable : &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robotic au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his counterpart from the G@@ 7 states , which will also come together with representatives from industry at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to make use of internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Economic Ministry , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; still , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital association , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; according to the current state of the year , the Düsseldorf wants only to beat the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the EM apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term ship meeting in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; explained the fifth @-@ fifth of the world @-@ tran@@ g@@ ist . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was taken at a Tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ fying human@@ ely thanks to video projections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing training .
&quot; the show is chron@@ ologically not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall piece of artwork for which much effort was done : to fro@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the Oktober@@ fest there was another special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always cared for strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the disc@@ arding of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought the then of course .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ en lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes resulted in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en bo@@ bb@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important once more . &quot;
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and was then pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styles of style , is growing expon@@ enti@@ ally . &quot;
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the Industry Association of P@@ lau@@ er lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken away . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date on Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery factory in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Exter@@ enst@@ elle of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
therefore an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base .
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in this process , the machine sti@@ cking little chi@@ cks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; before that I could not start with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener summit . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ en Peak - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic little girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday , a group charged with steering reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it provides the market with a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve gifts . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Organisation Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that , on the basis of the still present limit values , approximately 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , according to Food@@ watch , the EU plans to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sin@@ king in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans that accumulate in predat@@ ory fish above all in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; very small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; especially in un@@ born damage . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly due to coal combustion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants send more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide crossed , &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
