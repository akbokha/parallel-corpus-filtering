Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ l and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zi@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb made the disa@@ strous distress at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ l died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , comprising 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb commen@@ ded , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problems .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest amendments to the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , he did a doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar play . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ l obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the cry of emergency , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ l , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but were friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ l when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared on a summer carnival three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ l was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ l Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his brother and student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community took part in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony at the Cle@@ vel@@ and Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the University choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ l called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor for the holiday season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it will not be so many Christmas seasonal employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equip shops with employees who sell , sell , sell and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox exc@@ ites on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also notable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated stit@@ ching and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is , &quot; There is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief demands again all parties , including the split UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; Ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at p@@ olls , it doesn &apos;t work yet . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one was able to win only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he should fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values which indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
mp popularity ratings have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
&quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot;
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ p@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; angry &quot; if he were the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is seen in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively run his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their schol@@ arly hats , Republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp is real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l from the past week , four out of ten believe that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er Tru@@ mps campaign can be considered plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the mp leadership while the anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot;
&quot; ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before margin Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp , say that they have firmly par@@ don@@ ed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp has been an im@@ migrant from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was the hub in public discourse about 2016 . &quot;
&quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep major His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party , and will damage the New @-@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l on Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , there seems to be Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
fru@@ stration on the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; by now , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new monthly pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with experience of government . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely angry . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential buildings in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg path , the most expensive residential complex is located - with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study demonstrates in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the prices comes up like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ er@@ prizes in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , with a good mind . &quot;
but good for who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top here as an exception . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ ture in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch@@ urn of Pi@@ ra@@ eus a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their inau@@ g@@ ural game in the Champions League in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth launch of the series is to be the first step towards fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to win the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received good co @-@ help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who was allowed to pass a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium ahead of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without glit@@ tering .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent six home games in the top class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled at ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European teams with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bra@@ vely , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were introduced too often by allu@@ ding to left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k crashed out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ che@@ que .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by direct debit the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had played their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle pun@@ ches . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was allowed to leave .
&quot; for instance , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing training , &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer , &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the defeated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put on it . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partially m@@ um@@ bled Bayern fans in their audience block obviously provoked the fans of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study close . &quot;
&quot; the good news : in the event of ren@@ unciation , the risk decl@@ ines fast . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and dental loss is due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers . &quot;
it is not clear to the extent that smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the danger again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained by the British University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health down to high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists rep@@ el lef@@ to@@ vers from late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ au@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; close to the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remnants of historical buildings , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is constantly being consul@@ ted as a specialist for archae@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards &quot; &quot; section , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress was standing , and in the 8th century a church was standing , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission is propos@@ ing a new court in dispute on TTIP
&quot; to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which significantly exceeds traditional courts in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de tried to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is supposed to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically show that the EU states and the US jointly determine independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow to raise objection to jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved themselves with each other on the refer@@ ee , but there was no objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system regarding fair@@ ness and justice . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings requested above all by major corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , where firms can enforce compensation for the tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ elling national laws , or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act had inadequate the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig , ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into consideration key points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economy &apos;s pi@@ anos to many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .

the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club in Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has turned out to be a wonderful creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift in great opul@@ ence at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a promising series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans have already appeared and have a positive outlook . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician from New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
over@@ taking ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs have long gone out , the stage shows here are a colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent sta@@ de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; plate in the bottom &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only for an en@@ core thanks to St@@ ev@@ ens modest , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and finally bows down under a thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been anticipated with tension at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and for the first time invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch whereby his capacity is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to wait on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several song pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are stack@@ ed within the Labour &quot; &quot; stack &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes put forward in order to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister said that the party is &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been the T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy set , says he has &quot; &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the sab@@ otage of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from in@@ timi@@ dation and stri@@ fe , instead of concentrating on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , who is responsible for the shadows of economic ministers , if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also introduced the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ kow , speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; j@@ ester theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s frame . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and oppres@@ sive reforms . &quot;

pound increases through accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound grew br@@ ittle according to data indicating an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and achieved assessments on the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % from the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index topped with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry &apos;s shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares climbed 5 % after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sold his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .

who is it@@ ching ?
the fans are not .
also Bi@@ eber itself does not .
he has already taken care of them .
&quot; for advertisement in the advertising break of the super@@ script he invested three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le firm , many , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber is also cas@@ c@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you &apos;re amazed at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; others stress that , finally , in the US and the United Kingdom , Bi@@ eber has been ranked # 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least it does this way .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato mas@@ h idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ess@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , there is a grill sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese in the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers .
Met@@ a launches a ground @-@ breaking campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ - inv@@ a@@ sions
Met@@ ric tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell award @-@ approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investor @-@ strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will be sn@@ apping about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and taking away all the existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that , next year , Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in simultaneous sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging san@@ i@@ tization programs at El@@ an are growing , hoping that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is ear@@ ns rather praise as cri@@ tique of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ g@@ and deserves praise as a critic for his own behavior in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s in@@ famous confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have hit Kyr@@ g@@ ish , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f sh@@ ook a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am more demanding is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the conflict , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he &apos;s not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he &apos;s not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even in the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Cy@@ ren@@ ames in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and sm@@ ashed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Ser@@ b officials with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian dispens@@ ary . &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border did not meet a common immigration policy a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the un@@ spoiled Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not rely on Brussels or its neighbors to act soon . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation , which was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were used in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament still needs to agree on the military deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quickly re@@ pairing the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounding the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd in order to enter into it . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ di@@ ting for the presi@@ dency , receives 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders can only return to 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit margin with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries declared that they would support Clinton when nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially thrilled by her .
the views are mixed more strongly with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with the problems and the voting will also be quoted .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the prim@@ aries who are their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den does not decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders is increasing , from 20 points with bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate stands out to be unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results on some key characteristics of voters choosing their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since there are questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has worsen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good leadership . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ esty , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is now om@@ itted , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes trust among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , was beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - he lands 19 % support with Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent ABC News / Washington Post pol@@ l showed also Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the tru@@ mp faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for seaside vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a deportation ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported . &quot;
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal through a frozen field .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide the utensils and basically put the br@@ otherhood on the part of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; frat@@ ernity and its members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of Shi@@ ane attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the br@@ otherhood , and the national frat@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the land@@ se is going to drop , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve upon raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in net interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal levels , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to be seas@@ oned for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , which Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ding later in the increase cycle and returns on margin to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often support them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in an increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP has been below 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; Is it different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed to raise the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to present have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
firm income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in net interest and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the loans return immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to conver@@ ging returns between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the radio station for its &quot; &quot; sil@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial rivals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private parties do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously called examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 would be far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work was needed to engage the audience when it did this in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tramp@@ le on the commercial rivals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in special BBC mode .
he added that he wants the company to &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house cow@@ shed &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment begins .
&quot; however , he refused to include the order of further rows of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fee collectors for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales rose at the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has dri@@ lled and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that online sales were boo@@ sted three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ itting itself , and we may experience that growth will be less@@ ened . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for failing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of 5 £ issues a little more than 1 £ was spent online .
&quot; for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ kings in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially de@@ posed the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 injured were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed , who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the beg@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king committed a san@@ ction over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators , who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the p@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man lied to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the p@@ addle , which will be held later this month , were gathered . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree did not rebu@@ ke the group because of its current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a apo@@ state son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family during the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
&quot; government officials stipul@@ ated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other criminals will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
&quot; the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled crafts@@ man from Eastern Europe has a rise behind him
&quot; this means that 200 additional screening shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is said that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople who carry out works in their home .
&quot; if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British employ more and more arti@@ sans in order to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , has now been over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women to deal with B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this to a balance more strongly .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK leader in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues after the Group inde@@ xed the costs of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob for un@@ faith@@ fulness to court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants did not conf@@ ine themselves guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , he cryst@@ alli@@ zed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the accused used funds from club accounts to which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial reasons .
&quot; this fact was evi@@ den@@ ced by the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ ler , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; in order to disc@@ la@@ ve the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that the association had not come into existence at any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would have only charged allowance damage and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession Major audi@@ tor of the Finanz@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have fired up money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debts must be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , reimbur@@ sement of expenses reimbur@@ sed retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance damage was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Pau@@ l@@ ump and not detailed projections seemed to appear , the former Ob@@ mann explained the events . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and accounts led@@ gers administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in the details of the financial burden , important was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account in 2011 against the one official investig@@ ator for official abuse . &quot;
&quot; that was the case , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was on the name of the second accused , and according to his statement , the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot;
this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; compensation claim . &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , wanted judges and prosec@@ utor to know . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1,000 euros per month at diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were unable to present accurate records for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept , after an operation examination , in which everything had been judged correctly . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the adjustments are made in cash , so he said in his statement from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial continues on 23 September with a survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard orders more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to staff cuts running for the past three years , the computer giant will disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Computer terri@@ fic He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate branch . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special exposure of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the 5@@ 5.000 jobs , which have been running for three years , have not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent on the market share .
&quot; the company , which is grown with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a once again dis@@ appointing PC market , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services , used the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to use the latest Lenovo Ide@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and do more and more business immediately online . &quot;
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans will see a total of about 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly come down to rejection : 54 percent said against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other countries fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; however , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed , the Hungarian police used against several hundred displaced persons . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind the police , there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water thro@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles . &quot;
the officials first put an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
afterwards the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees put together and suffered under the short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police officers also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half of the opinion that the F@@ ed is going to do , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be held . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 pm CE@@ T on Thursday .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; make it happen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller on his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ l , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to undo it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ l had also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ l was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ l had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ l was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ l worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ l . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ l , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University , such as his E@@ ger on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans to build a large corporate structure .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost the job at work . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and adds value to the cheap Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to contribute to a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings budget line should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the company wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the Pilot @-@ Clean cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the un@@ stopp@@ able strike . &quot;

the topic of the talks should be the retirement planning for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit would come with a projected record result &quot; as quickly as possible to achieve sustainable results . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline in recent months led to several strikes .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought the left outer defender to the weeping and exclu@@ des him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ itter escape .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked like it &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , gives instead a content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; reads . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a young named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the cov@@ et@@ ous , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ rough frustr@@ ating Once @-@ ler despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ ur@@ ry being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral circus .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England chose for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
hopefully further runs out for Yor@@ k@@ shire will get another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer I highly appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and received four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I don &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed guy has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred ranks right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes back to the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed with him as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup @-@ spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; the team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , was not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I don &apos;t have any problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ completed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU now is , and not always on their own fault , the UK itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an out@@ sider Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the over@@ power@@ ing long endurance athletes such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may intentionally not plan deliberate comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ac@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum in 1975 , that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ pr@@ ying ro@@ gue , telephone ch@@ opping foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ nation@@ als most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you &apos;re sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;ll get better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it very friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ man can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ &apos;s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and depu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the curved bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even stir@@ red up - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ wing dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power on which I was reminded of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criterion decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he was also part of the session . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he , that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die yearly from a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by pointing out the current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders , says former CEO of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for the fact that they are publicly available programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and stations like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time frame because they want to reach as wide support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am proud to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC should be on the hunt for reviews because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , that BBC shows should sell like East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure rather the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue when they &apos;re on their seem@@ ing missions to justify four billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course you think everyone , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example on the public television stations in Australia and Canada , in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and entertaining . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and deal with the commercial channels alliances in order to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
&quot; scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves . &quot;
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; the impulses are caused by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion cann@@ als carry . &quot;
&quot; when turning ultras@@ on@@ ically onto the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ h@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired point in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ore , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you do not love or hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; people often turn into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , movie night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people wear and their under@@ wear acc@@ ru@@ e . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll @-@ culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ ek .
&quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have made you something . so , and now please smile when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you knock . &quot;
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ching of chickens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced approach than my room@@ mate who added a rin@@ se to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it was something for them to make Drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbors asleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same residence hall ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her again , dis@@ connect , and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she re@@ treats all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your under@@ belly a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but keep your holding on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ ten@@ ders , minor ear@@ ners &quot;
real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; that is , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build a good and cheap way today , &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great deal here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ Regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that hardly could afford more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght returns or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able through the sli@@ mming of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located close to a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , since the phone may switch on half way and this could lead to a crash of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot muster the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the Chess Club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; besides consultations , you can also participate in courses there . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for many years now , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently , many benefits of the insurance are not claimed , because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
&quot; for this , a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg is essential in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) underlined at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
this makes the Sozial@@ stiftung a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as far as possible .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 years old passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of the Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday . &quot;
with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus will lose an honorary member and at the same time one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna during and after the Second World War with Friedrich Leh@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute leader . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute for For@@ estry . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;
parking penalty : Tim Wiese offers a polic@@ e@@ woman with money
&quot; ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was killed in Bremen , Germany . &quot;

&quot; according to our own statement , 30 kilograms of muscle mass has been added over the past two years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has not intellectu@@ ally listened to it . &quot;
&quot; in the inner city of Bremen , Wiese was just cutting his hair when he saw how outside a parking space guard issued a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese was stor@@ med from the shop , insul@@ ted the officials and threw down the fine fin@@ es in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual occurrence . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only then will be decided whether meadow will be shown or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the area of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young people , and struck the face with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l outbreak and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when one no longer saw the vehicle , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was re@@ ass@@ aul@@ ted by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a head@@ stock , the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs were indic@@ ative . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; up to now , only a v@@ ague description of the day is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in height .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and advis@@ ers to sign out on the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; furthermore , the German mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over Fel@@ ce@@ ausen &apos;s practice on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase Müller will open the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was a sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms of the field met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their professional training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also want to enter into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ins would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Regen@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed to volunteer in the DRC &apos;s prepar@@ edness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from the 19th of September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros will be donated by the Müll@@ ers within the framework of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and from the seed community ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; said vel@@ vet mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , by the way also still looks familiar with familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the rocky out@@ sides . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen recalls . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly she felt after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients a lot of time , &quot; says the student . &quot;
&quot; her husband , laughing , adds : &quot; we have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border stay in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for a asylum request can &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; do this . &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia wants to move incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and possibly er@@ ect corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to avoid barriers to refugees . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it deals mainly with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country comp@@ lies with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were diver@@ ted from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the people to suggest certain routes : &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id . in the course of the day , more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should travel here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it could indeed come to a somewhat further west stretch of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on ser@@ bian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried Wednesday morning at a local presence in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature . &quot;
it would not currently be about very high numbers of refugees .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their trip through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise job migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of Croatia still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime , which is accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their worries , partly quick steps , partly cozy . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keeping track of the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with beautiful autumn sun shine and middle of four big panels each with the heading &quot; &quot; Bev@@ or I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce subsi@@ ded with this action on its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer says . &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as the voluntary workers .
&quot; while a Pass@@ ant spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and writes the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , little discussion about the action in itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that some@@ day the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to disclose themselves to the tablets is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people . &quot;
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ and@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ant is one of the volunteer staff of the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was sought by volunteers by calling an official official , she immediately reported and was there with the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her job and experience and experience .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
other personal wishes can be recorded on postcards as well .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter and the supplier giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told us to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view , despite the price increases , will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ board transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; the company yields solid income if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for summer holidays were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to adjust 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour power , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned revenues of $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six analysts questioned by Z@@ acks were expecting $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net transport sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues because of higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labor costs in freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock declined by 3.@@ 85 $ or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time . &quot;
&quot; there is a mur@@ al of the United States , lo@@ oming over them at an end of the orn@@ ate two @-@ storey palace hall . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets may frigh@@ ten the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to enhance this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing is in@@ secure by itself to the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted an interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets are expecting to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decrease in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed Policy persi@@ sts in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her declaration to so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in net interest would ease financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase of the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation continued under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sha@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a bit this month , and the Dow falls by almost 10 % below May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences complex calculation when increasing interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would wear the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former director , Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial markets , apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to raise interest rates , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its share in three sessions by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market share , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should hurry up time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a bewil@@ dering number of fresh , frozen and dried produce , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the coff@@ ers and has various collection options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat @-@ counter is extensive , as well as the fish @-@ counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even roast on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop is part of the massive freeze department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and g@@ all , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef and g@@ all , pigs , fish , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commerci@@ alised foods and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , is not without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a body and soul teacher .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , that &apos;s quite different teaching than at a real school . &quot;
Brazilian Pon@@ di@@ at@@ rical Society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nour@@ ishment for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ rical organization SP@@ RS is trying to explain how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck on breasts which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should take . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turnkey construction on the Bern@@ ese Sports Centre are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest joint meeting , the completed construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the committee had already decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ otic first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is planned : &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again the til@@ ting of the roof , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; therefore , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan has no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to the til@@ ting of the roof , whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council is generally more restric@@ tive with liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym @-@ building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and mass sports promotion .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres hall will now be presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the staff are pulling from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is what the surprising plans of the administrative district of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this may meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has now switched to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree that both houses lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ech , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be closed defini@@ tively in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing renovation was completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; Mr J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß couldn &apos;t say there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , Car@@ itas and Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry are accommodated there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; Fischer said about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positively and very understandable by the employees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has worked as chief physician for more than 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 h ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;

Jag@@ dun@@ ov with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the Aber@@ n@@ garten on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police told . &quot;
&quot; after a firing , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; at first , it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident . &quot;
the C@@ ID has been identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and cast their bodies into a channel in rock @-@ breaks . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old who has been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; also on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was deemed to be suspect , who , according to the fact , admitted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after having not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the group of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old finally revealed himself . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported to police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had killed and laid the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be kept on Wednesday at the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put him in charge . &quot;
the further investigation shall bring about the closer circum@@ stance of the deed .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
distribution disputes on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; association was commissioned . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were lod@@ ged in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market does not only depend on the growing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the residential construction policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing for a residential deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently there have already been some 70@@ ,000 residential units in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation areas . Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities and shared flat @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ willingly for a longer stay at the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the noise on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost the social housing construction again . &quot;
this could be wai@@ ved for the property tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed housing needs to be suspended .
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are needed according to the Alliance . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have been raised on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million . &quot;
now the project could be even increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no passing through to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border was cut off , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people had come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; however , after the shut@@ down of the border no more refugees come to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 challenged people . &quot;
just before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law stages the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
35 pen@@ alties were therefore initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday we received a total of 94 asylum applications in the &quot; Tran@@ sit ons &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important passage in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
f@@ enced bars have been disman@@ tled and one of the host families in the bor@@ der@@ land has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees reach Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people wait for the continuation to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the celebration of the bridge on Sunday , we were busy with cleaning up when suddenly ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , however , for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ deserved guests cal@@ med down at once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we said in the same way that we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man would not be allowed to give a generous donation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to reach the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ leg course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ cris@@ y politics :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly supported the position of the Hungarian government in the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; the refugees will have to find that the &quot; praised land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad is already under control of the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen refugee centre .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also without great vor@@ tices , &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Konrad calcul@@ ates a total of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in a he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create lod@@ gings for the next refugees . &quot;
&quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to explain how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that quot@@ as must comply with a certain amount of towel holders or size of the duties . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in placing , &quot; &quot; says Konrad , with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t give the Republic any cost as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
&quot; until now , the search for own lod@@ gings has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can be subject to these measures at the moment , &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the City Council has critic@@ ised the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a prolonged telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has made further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria is now also introducing controls on its borders , &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially closed .
&quot; the listed IT Group S &amp; T is set in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ Fir@@ ms of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire some of them .
&quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T has invested 3.1 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to break the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : finally , she has now grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la Shop , opposite the store , where she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything is now about women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has got incub@@ ation from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women look at the sight of a hand@@ bag in the rap@@ ture , the expert is not able to answer with the last safety . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s up to you that a nice bag of every outfit will be enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always a good one .
&quot; whether it is alien@@ ating xen@@ opho@@ bic , re@@ porters or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office raises the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen C@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker , with the &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fres@@ hen &quot; , &quot; is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße . &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ area is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the city leader Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to whom besides Tru@@ mp the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , I think that &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dently loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in Hoch@@ deutsch : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first real estate acquisitions in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once had been cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as it is pol@@ ed , this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of the city of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension t@@ ress Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he won &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had Sa@@ y at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as protective area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show . &quot;
&quot; according to Can@@ ber@@ ra , Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s evalu@@ ations . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers because sunrise had an average 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities , compared to today &apos;s today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in recent months Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August Today , Today , at an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now , Sun@@ rise faces an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these da@@ w@@ men more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators on average . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery un@@ v@@ eils ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly clearly who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
the wife at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood finishes his lips tightly to the final on Thursday
&quot; in a ly@@ rical way , all three women have wondered why Wood is the perfect man and they named his sense of humour , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods final rose ? &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game corruption who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were fairly compatible and I &apos;ve thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to him condition@@ ally , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next chance to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordin@@ ators Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his caught mu@@ zzle and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ nes compared the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin Debut in 2007 , when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin met to discuss the rights of gay men
&quot; Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian run@@ way with armed force . &quot;

&quot; due to the high refugee numbers , free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis in Bay@@ erns schools , if there were no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; Friday , Friday , Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commune . &quot;
&quot; actually , there were other main topics . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ torate .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria as it gave them during the Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Liber@@ al vot@@ er . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need unified federal standards nationwide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy should not fall under the table in the city of Groß@@ wall@@ stadt . &quot;
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the order of the day : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started pilot study &quot; &quot; Middle @-@ level plus &quot; &quot; at 47 high schools where an extension of the upper secondary school was tested for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
festive Wall Street helps Da@@ x on jumps
&quot; the German stock market has closed , after a long @-@ term , trend @-@ free and nervous process of trading . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock markets provided a clear direction that promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized score won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the key index of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid winn@@ ings also posted business places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently recorded some 1 percent in the Plus . &quot;
&quot; many stock exchanges reck@@ on that markets up to the interest rate in the US , and also the major decline in the fut@@ ures market , will be on the spot this Friday . &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E to record low and left a mark on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Da@@ x , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors obliged to pay little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investment in promising waf@@ er technology and the focus on the car market should be paid off . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were again set aside than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA did at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW reached 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on stock of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the euro &apos;s course decreased to CHF 1.@@ 12@@ 62 . &quot;
&quot; against mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday said . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief district officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air , before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ers say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 sq@@ .@@ m area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commercial and living is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and the building which is located on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor has made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ gli@@ ders are further troubled - they fear the sale of their recreational drug
&quot; months have been negotiated , ch@@ apped , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are lying on the table .
&quot; the stak@@ eholder , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ press Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on to the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners who arrived at the meeting arous@@ ed the images and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of a mer@@ gers and a board member in the interests of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z overlooking all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , as a number of other project critics , he fears that the transport through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : &quot; there must be whole bus charges for that to be reck@@ oned &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches promotional donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip belonged to many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four charitable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / quarters were doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
reporting by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , loss of weight can be helpful . &quot;
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c con@@ ges@@ tion - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I below those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dis@@ connected and 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to this , diabetes was completely dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the ga@@ it @-@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and more of a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not benefit survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is lying with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently taking notice in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was conclu@@ ding . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama sang Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the road to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this provoked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which so@@ ck strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 were reported to report toxic control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children could visi@@ bly drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers are said to have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ hai@@ red Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had taken up four sy@@ ringe barrels of Stra@@ w@@ berry dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally regarded as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ hai@@ red l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to death cases . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; teachers by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; the police considered the sh@@ attered plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors of disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insisted that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored by Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland there are no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ aring Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which is now at the top of the table with five points ahead , followed . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel that exactly so - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising overall .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland was 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the rate of employment for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I witnessed an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; somewhat later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear myself . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see backgrounds in the US , and since there are often more applications available than places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after firing police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a house peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cobal@@ t t@@ amp@@ on rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk around my head , and I want my owners to think that I will do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb rise in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this take me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and inf@@ ringe me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination near Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; throw out his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday all the day that was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver cur@@ sed
the police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and pad@@ dock in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be charged for driver cur@@ ses and sub@@ missi@@ veness and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . it is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against rival because of claims to ring struggling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as the &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a careful note to the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team is confident of him , because they were worried that they were worried about being struck by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this time again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year long , but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons played the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a mess . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks doing and no points a bit exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team has released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who may be threatened with a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ mes of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long punishment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been of a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escap@@ ing Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against caution , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports on the police daily and stops at an initial bul@@ lock of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left in the last moment , as the police told . &quot;
the accident @-@ causing driver &apos;s cab was completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; the result was a damage amounting to 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it through , found the bewil@@ dering news and al@@ er@@ ted immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then asser@@ ted against the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the requirements and did not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since it can be argued that &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; can be found in its off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security in this case , but was kept in custody pending hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ g@@ users left the people out of fear of discovery and arrest on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the federal police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they had come to the German side by foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ age .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; at Munich Central Station , more refugees arrived after federal police statements as compared to the week of the week . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which over the past few days was pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with goats from 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , there is mainly a movement in the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment , according to the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is launching an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf with a view , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the major competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is also visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA : new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he comes to the trade , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is quite new in the segment .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , however , there is also a diesel powered by 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque depends on manufacturer &apos;s specifications for 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n inspec@@ tor put their hand in front of the front . here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were equipped . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants at the IAA in the compact class , such as the consolidated Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Enfor@@ cement Institute Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
&quot; in a decision published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that . &quot;
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was once again on the open foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant against the State of Berlin failed because of the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges lifted up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
Kammer@@ gericht now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a disgu@@ ise of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; thus they first spoke of a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was locked naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to human dignity , a decision of 2011 also shows the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel incident in November 2009 . &quot;
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also gone into the head@@ lines because of missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore continually included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even in case of massac@@ res it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Office of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; &quot; I say again and again , we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing prices fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80 000 social housing would have to be built every year , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critici@@ zes Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they will find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; it is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on labour for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residence duty , the asylum seekers limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the point of view prevailed in the majority of ways that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is , in the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Work Integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the root parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schema , spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes leaflets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators is to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for instruction . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ case from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position . &quot;
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a re@@ payment or toler@@ ation do not receive services according to the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of persons under the brun@@ t . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years now , in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this gap is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; in future , Islam will play an important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually expose the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law to further develop a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
duties are also part of the rights .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant them certain controls . &quot;
this also includes readiness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany has , as a result of European decisions , an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German demand long and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are committed , must become a reality in the coming years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , writes Professor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding man@@ power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money would have to flow into the system for this . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites everyone to receive health cards immediately when registering . &quot;
services provided could later be settled by the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut as many people with the limited service catalogue that fores@@ ees the asylum application law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors will mainly make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would need to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already been helped with more general medical points of contact in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , there is much more un@@ attended han@@ di@@ caps , and the young people are about HIV . &quot;
&quot; but with the partially different disease pictures , German doctors would come up with her training , &quot; &quot; says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as for the medical profession , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated by allevi@@ ation . &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system ; several refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass ex@@ ams again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherapy Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a trau@@ matic Stress Dis@@ order suffers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Flas@@ h@@ backs &quot; &quot; with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death threats . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include bed@@ - and concentration disturbances , strong timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ assessments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on a brick @-@ based v@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the family thus lies in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this flair .
the circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo will be able to take up the duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; apart from numerous sal@@ mons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with intuition and jo@@ int@@ iness . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
snake humans fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are too often the subject of different animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes up his position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read off by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , there should be something like this . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst , from 17 to 20 September , invites you to your performances every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the screening at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations of opposition from the opposition , that they had received anonymous threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokesperson for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Parliament members affected that immunity in the Parliament will end , and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is concerned about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and spar@@ ing efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; said the company &apos;s declaration . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage you have called &quot; the Si@@ licon Valley &quot; birth@@ place .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; in contrast to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , Wen@@ ger emphasized that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss out at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly still be uncertain . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; this type of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , who have recorded most vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the ratio of injuries will continue during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have an over@@ due period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ attered by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven away from the far @-@ away hope of leading the association with his first European apo@@ calyp@@ se triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mur@@ der@@ ers among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ tification ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign Against a miserable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that men hin@@ der to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms observed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication managed through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even though they often go back to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone service , I explained : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term locking mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to sm@@ ash Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they do not only aim at qualifying for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later became in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t get one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could last weekend a 2 : 2 Draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went to Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to reach this stage , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ an@@ ini used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he played his fellow players and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacing opponent Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
&quot; based in Switzerland , the Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt settlement plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion , in order to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion dollar share sale last week , as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe out around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion stocks worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the group . &quot;
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese president Xi J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in this evening , the U.S. President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi &apos;an and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders conducted bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President X@@ is &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington , before heading to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi &apos;an are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ es@@ pi@@ onage in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented the change to FC Bayern in 2008
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously a few years ago , the FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times champion League winner , two times champion League winner , two times European Champion , once World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was before the European Championship before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rou@@ man@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .

Matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a episode of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian fes@@ tiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down on the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing the film ; Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against condem@@ nation of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to apply discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album sil@@ ently &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports climbing and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; the contest show , which just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competitor who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; managing director K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has got any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins wa@@ ved a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Pi@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ ken@@ nel Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; he has done well , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks hit a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy crossed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run , Ver@@ hagen put the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was hitting a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth inning , Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run , wall made an R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders st@@ ach S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been eliminated before the game by the injury list after he lack@@ ed more than one month for a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , Hus@@ ked gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not strike very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count and scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s right @-@ handed people .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and one walk with four strokes . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the limbs .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the injury list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday .
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the most anger@@ ed people will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden met on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it estimated 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ capital were prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily suspended .
they should then be distributed to other commun@@ es .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , who had been responsible for the first @-@ month investigation . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; collective views &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister for Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , to Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , sent no refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the general manager for public safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann conven@@ ed a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt to distribute more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee success in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ life and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , however , on the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancell@@ ery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; however , Merkel under@@ lines those people who need protection . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective cannot stay in Germany either .
this conception was in@@ sist@@ ently shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania had to be sealed with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers wanted to avoid ev@@ asion over Romania . Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice cream of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ aps . &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon sw@@ ings slightly on its path around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this exchange movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( U.S. State of New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal I@@ car@@ us .
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ ew water vap@@ our and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed . &quot;
&quot; the extension of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for approximately one month .
a study conducted by the 27 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ duc@@ tor viol@@ ated the association .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of a non @-@ in@@ compatible professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; following his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie will return to the team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to jump into running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at the head .
&quot; however , contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line , will often get dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because Man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Al@@ most , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor Beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; eating the fruits supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone does not say anything about the ripe fruit , so green man@@ gos can also taste delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney suits fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US package service U@@ PS will again provide up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the US .
&quot; the company already started to recru@@ it seasonal workers , announced U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 hil@@ es for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and on the night of Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the gro@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the mountain@@ side , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the hair @-@ dryer blows up until Thursday morning in the tor@@ ches with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adic@@ ally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair dryer can penetrate occasionally to the adjacent mid@@ range , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow on the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain continues , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , in the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this has to be expected in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air dri@@ es out , as a result a cold front with strong , partly clou@@ dy rain from west to east over Switzerland rolls . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind dri@@ es up steep@@ ly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it is sunny and warmer on the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , in the presence of mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park was chri@@ sten@@ ed in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) presented himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a rotten sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
&quot; with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment trade , Luther initiated the split in the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus , with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns , is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with sump@@ tuous images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective themes can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds , or father@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today &apos;s contexts , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Scrip@@ tural quotation from Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry box has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; the education took place already with the cane stock , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work out , in order to be able to carry me back with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to bring art back to more significance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , &quot; discover them , discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art to be : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care to fully grasp the Bible , but have chosen the most important and mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill deported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the permission will be received in October , the first municipal manager Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its engagement for refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga faces a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football responds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its help in tac@@ kling the problems that are tac@@ kled .
&quot; I consider this as the biggest challenge of our country since unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can tell in principle that this doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for each individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and will help .
&quot; the decisive course , however , must pose the policy . &quot;
&quot; the German So@@ ccer Federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; declared Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal agencies also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will wear the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only be , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot;
&quot; we can use football teams , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements in their places had started their own projects would be great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up all the money for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : head of the SAP board loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost his left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , after midnight he fell on a glass of water , which he bore in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , he was power@@ less , he then dra@@ gged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually moves between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you have fallen .

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football league in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ank@@ el will not only change his elf position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of gene@@ alogy Roman bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games , Tu@@ k@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by Mit@@ tee R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers medium @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl for trac@@ eable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robotic cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his counterpart colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which will also come together with representatives from the industry at the International Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to employ around the world that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 can be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; still , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital network of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , the traffic in flowing traffic could imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances left to the car .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current state of the year , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf wants to hit the title fight from September 25 to October 4 only in singles . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the European training course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ fying human@@ ely thanks to video projections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became a great star in the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if one dies , one gets to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is chron@@ ologically not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was spent : to fro@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the casting of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , but of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes resulted in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en bo@@ des . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important once more . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
we already have half of all orders with us .
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; in the past 15 years , around 80 percent of the sales were broken away . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Exter@@ enst@@ elle of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in this process , the machine sti@@ cking little chi@@ cks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mind in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; before I could start nothing with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener summit . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and environ@@ s and want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film

&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic pa@@ w@@ n@@ anny . &quot;

XI ur@@ ges to open economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was mand@@ ated with steering reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business environment and shaping the market more openly , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve gifts . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Organisation Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper in the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plan : &quot; risks and side effects failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers &quot; , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so strongly charged with mercury , that on the basis of the still present limit values approximately 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller grav@@ ey@@ ards , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sin@@ king in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans that accumulate in predat@@ ory fish above all in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in un@@ born fo@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly due to carbon combustion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants rep@@ el more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide crossed , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted out of paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
