&quot; road vehicles or trucks carrying a TI@@ R transport must carry a rectangular , the characteristics of the anne@@ x 5 corresponding table with the inscription &quot; TI@@ R . &quot; &quot;
these panels must be appropriate that they are well visible ; they must be removable .
&quot; ( 1 ) For every street vehicle or container , a separate Car@@ net TI@@ R can be completed . &quot;

&quot; - on the road a control and a complaint of the goods loading of road vehicles , trucks or containers . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities take a notice of the cargo loading of a road vehicle , a truck or a container at a transit point or on the road , so they must be noted on the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections , which are used in their country , on the respective regular sheets and on the sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections and the type of controls carried out in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; customs caps are viol@@ ated or damaged in other cases in the articles 24 and 35 , or if goods are damaged or damaged without breach of the customs regulations , the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 shall remain un@@ affected by the use of the Car@@ net TI@@ R and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R ; the internal legal regulations remain un@@ affected . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R does not use the Car@@ net in the area of a contracting party because easier procedures for customs handling are offered or the use of such a method is not required . &quot;

&quot; one of the customs authorities has been provided with satisfactory evidence that the goods listed in the Manifest@@ o of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have gone under accident or higher violence , or that they are absent from natural pigs because of their nature , thus exemp@@ tion from the tur@@ mo@@ il to up@@ lifting tari@@ ffs and roy@@ alties is granted . &quot;

a ) The organization meets all precau@@ tions to protect business and industrial secrets as well as other confidential information from which they are acknowledged in the implementation of this convention .
&quot; II ) Com@@ ple@@ tion of core material , which is subject to the provisions of the Convention , may be published on the Council &apos;s decision and with the consent of the immediately affected states or the community , as far as each of the two parties is concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) In the implementation of securing measures in accordance with this agreement , the technological development is fully charged in the field of securing measures , and all efforts are made to ensure the optimal cost effectiveness and application of the principle of effective hed@@ ging monitoring of the flow of core material , which is subject to the use of instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology makes this possible . &quot;
&quot; B ) To guarantee the optimal cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial f@@ ing@@ ling as a means for determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the follow @-@ up procedure on the phases of the fuel cycle , which may affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material , without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The effective implementation of the securing measures pursuant to this Convention grants the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention Information on core material , which is subject to securing measures , and about the characteristics of the equipment used to carry out the securing measures concerning this material from Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on investments are limited to the minimum level necessary for the application of securing measures in relation to core material , which is subject to the securing measures pursuant to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data that considers the community as vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organization to be converted into material , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization brings the approval of the Community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) In@@ cre@@ ases the community either against a proposed designation or at any time against an appointed appointment , thus the organization of the community and the states proposes one or more alternative names . &quot;
&quot; if due to the re@@ peti@@ tive refusal of the Community to appro@@ ve the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ aired due to this convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal to discuss appropriate measures in the following as &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - in the following as &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the affected states undertake the necessary steps to ensure that inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their agreement , can actually carry out tasks . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) are the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge of familiar confidential information is ensured .
&quot; every state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , to carry out the relevant provisions of the agreement on the privileges and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures for this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to core material , when the community and the organization find that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear action , which is under the point of securing the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or practically cannot be re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
the Community notes the organization according to the provisions of this Convention the transfer of core material from the states that are subject to the securing measures according to the Convention .
&quot; the securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to core material as soon as the receiver state , as fores@@ een in the Convention , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries documents , from which any transmission and if necessary the re @-@ application of the backup measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to securing measures according to this agreement , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or pot@@ tery , so the community is agreed with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated according to this agreement regarding this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives in the long term of non @-@ application of the safety precau@@ tions .
B ) The organization and the community make a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied as long as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear action . &quot;
&quot; the organization is maintained over the total quantity and composition of the material in the respective state , or the material concerned , and any transmission of such material from this state or these states on the ongoing basis . &quot;
&quot; this explains their consent as soon as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or a secret knowledge of the military activity and does not apply to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in the implementation of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however , extraordinary expenses arising from a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has been answered beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in each case , the organisation carries out the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be applied to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the Community or State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or state due to damages , with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after checking the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council decides that the organization has not been able to verify that no core material , which has to be subject to securing measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive bodies , can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and possibly take the other measures planned there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account the measures taken by the applied security measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arise from the interpretation or application of this convention , are examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measure taken by the Council , any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal at the request of a party , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth , which will lead the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the community or organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ core states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
( II ) When the Community of the Organisation noti@@ fies that it is capable of applying its securing measures with regard to this state for the purposes of this convention .
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all member states of the organization of any change of this Convention .
( a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force for such a long time as the states are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures used in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning securing measures as necessary .
&quot; the aim of the safegu@@ ards specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant quantities of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such a junction by the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; to obtain the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting shall be used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified for the specified amounts for a certain period of time . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization is responsible for article 3 full use of the securing system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying their securing measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures will make use of the following methods and , as far as necessary , will see how they are determined and expe@@ dient in the supple@@ mentary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preserved , produced , failed , lost or otherwise dispos@@ able core material and stock ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure to determine , test and evaluate differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ure for ass@@ essing accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and report system , which displays the core material inventory and the changes of this inventory , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; ( g ) provisions , which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or during ore preparation .
&quot; B ) is ur@@ anium or th@@ orium containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear energy circuit described under the letter c ) , so the community of the organisation shares the amount and composition of the material , unless it is not established for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the core burning circuit produced core material in the states , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not permitted or desirable , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community establish agreement that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is above 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , from these securing measures , provided that the entire material quantity delivered to the states is no longer at any time due to this article in the states &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if liber@@ ated core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures pursuant to the Convention , provisions for the re @-@ application of the backup measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organization supple@@ mentary agreements , which is required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective management of the tasks of the organisation following this agreement , in the individual as the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot;
the supple@@ mentary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization , based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , represents a consolidated sub@@ directory of the whole , the securing measures of the underlying core material in the States , regardless of its origin , and will continue to carry out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and their member states Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( member states ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in Er@@ wa@@ eg@@ ung ( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program defined at the Conference for International Economic Co @-@ operation , to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ri@@ mental problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution to the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement , and the funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table which is visible in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization organis@@ es a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account ; this account will be governed by the organization as an administrator , and in this property the organization is defined in the following as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is seper@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the Member State , who are depos@@ ited on request in the currency of the respective state at Order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and depos@@ iting the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment takes place in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days after entry into force of this Agreement or another between the EE@@ G and the Administr@@ ative agreed at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator under consideration of the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional pun@@ ches on the cash or the scho@@ oling to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in order to grant this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and predictable economic problems ;
VI ) of the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounts ; and
VII ) to the extent that the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly withdraw@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered , approved , approved and administered for the organization of the organization funded by the organization ( including the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; therefore , they are pay@@ able for ten years each in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are directly to the organization that re@@ tains it .
&quot; any special loan agreement is to be ruled out by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special transaction loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services produced ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and that could be specified according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted , recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans take place in the special transaction account , and the amount returned in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until full disclosure of all the special transaction loans , the administrator will be informed of the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation and through the projects approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator has taught the E@@ EC quar@@ terly for the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses paid for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; the administrator convey@@ s the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the termination of the financial year of the organization , a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will be sent as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are made out of the account @-@ paid amounts and depos@@ ited from the account and withdraw@@ als to the member states . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the Administr@@ ators work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to do this , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time brings a exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or plans financed by special action plans and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organisation may agree , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement , the total capital amount paid by the recipients is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , so this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Council of the European Communities the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement will be effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of receipt of the aforementioned Noti@@ fications at the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two original manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , each wor@@ ding is binding . &quot;
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol no . 1 is to conclude the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE RE@@ LA@@ SS@@ EN :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation a common company according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics , and is very familiar with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is to carry out extensive work , it is in the interests of the contractual parties of the present agreement to sum up their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research that has attained higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to put any contracting party into the position to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps due to a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , resulting in the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective power generation by using the controlled fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II , herein@@ after &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or modified by the organs mentioned in article 5 to 10 and article 16 of the existing agreement that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the parties accept a new program , this is the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association , which is planned in paragraph 1 , is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has signed a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the aim of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties are called an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the date of the implementation of the present agreement to the Joint Business J@@ ET , whose statutes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland &apos;s contractual partners may become contractual partners of each contract whose goal is to be concluded in the context of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the organs charged with the carrying out of the Association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the implementation of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , in the following &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and co @-@ operation in all matters relating to the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , takes this task in relation to all research and development activities to which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and organis@@ es its T * degree in the interests of the two contractual parties to the common goal laid down in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the common objective of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are to be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G shall appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking to . &quot;
the Advisory Groups joining the V@@ G research proposals to provide the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme are concerned with regard to all research and development work that is refer@@ enced in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories carried out in the framework of the program are optimally util@@ ised , provide this task with regard to all research and development work that are under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees that have appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the means , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work that are under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F includes a representative for the core and energy research representative of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission regarding the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of the future programmes and the establishment of its comprehensive , co @-@ ordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have an advisory character . &quot;
the opinion of the V@@ G to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties participate in the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom program according to this agreement is set annually to an amount that is disputed at the costs of the Eur@@ atom program at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland re@@ jects the Joint Business J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the Financial Stat@@ ements of the Stat@@ ute of this Joint Business . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis which is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work , which are made on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;

&quot; I honor to give you the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government on the subject .
I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present writing with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government on the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ Z could conclude stand@@ by credit cards with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request .
&quot; the agreements could be signed up to the total amount of the application paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery plans of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in each stand@@ by credit , the BIS initially would take over a commitment to two years , with the possibility of extended periods without being exceeded a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; during the opening of the loans , as well as in the long @-@ term extension , the BIS would calculate a credit expansion commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draw would not be made before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of their own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies at the disposal of the BI@@ Z , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be dealt with in consideration of the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who apply the BI@@ Z at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BIS has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the rate of interest in the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to a corresponding margin hei@@ gh@@ tened Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; - fresh or frozen ham - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina are fixed to the following annual amount : 20 000 tonnes , expressed in weight of slaughter ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure the agreed amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and will be carried out according to the traditional supply forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties should consult each other before introducing such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the commun@@ ion is entitled to the protective clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the access to Argentina regulated in this agreement will not be affected by the Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the de@@ ple@@ tion of products recorded by this agreement to a rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the rate of de@@ ple@@ tion mentioned under number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 will be fixed to the community of 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaughter with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community is propos@@ ing provisions to prevent the sales of inter@@ ven@@ tional resi@@ dues of frozen meat due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of the Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community hereby agrees that any actual application of equipment or other subsi@@ dy measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , shall only be taken into account with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of the world trade with these products . &quot;

&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or frozen chicken - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat will ensure access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;

the provisions of this agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount invested in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of this agreement applies to the amount of the year until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount .

&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera of each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species , which are distinguished by the pre@@ conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved . &quot;
&quot; with others , referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; an ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells which are weak@@ ened in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for Ser@@ a &apos;s effectiveness to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison with C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended for the use of slides in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination at approximately 40 ° C within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ised by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; this ser@@ a is therefore only specific to the C @-@ An@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed within 30 seconds of visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ ha@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not included in any form of anti @-@ D ) , must exhibit a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals , or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E. ser@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be smaller than with the ant@@ aneous antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen which means those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; there ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells containing no A an@@ tigen which means those of the blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison , separated by A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances in the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen which means those of the blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison , with a surge of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s signature , so ag@@ glut@@ inated no un@@ laden human red blood cells , regardless of which blood type they belong to . &quot;
