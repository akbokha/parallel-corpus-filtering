this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ ls thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for preventing man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or the enam@@ el tablets in patients with difficulty preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as abili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , is effective in order to activate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of abili@@ fy , preventing recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three trials over up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study , in another study the efficacy of abili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of abili@@ fy injection solution was compared with a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment was investigated . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melt tabl@@ ettes and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients that received abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg , a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; when used to treat bi@@ polar disorder , abili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to 74 weeks , abili@@ fy prevented recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of abili@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the onset or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ oc@@ ele and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; when a patient treated with abili@@ fy symptoms and symptoms of a late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or in@@ definite high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with conv@@ ul@@ sions in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased mortality risk compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduction should be made . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ p@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be applied during pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative effect on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with aria , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of eps 19 % in patients was placebo treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients under the op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , did not result from medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of aria pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ dents had a response to the study medication , similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study agents including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sive rates scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was observed among significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a performance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly discussed over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , in terms of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ up analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety hygiene , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ stem cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds @-@ carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al rin@@ ds / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solution . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11@@ am of the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

it is thought that the effectiveness of aria pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the processed tablets , alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the onset or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

it is thought that the effectiveness of aria pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was observed among significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to intake with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11@@ am of the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections solution is used to quickly control Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in the rotation of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used already for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medication to include abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy processed tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the aria @-@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( either prescribed or illegal ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ oc@@ ele and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was higher compared with the random@@ ised gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly applied and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduction should be made . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after all@@ ure of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of eps 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , did not result from medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution compared to placebo and was similar to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time trial ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms related to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour limit was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agi@@ tation , a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ dents responded to the study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study agents , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion Rate , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction of the rate of return which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed himself in terms of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until the maximum plasma length was applied at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which lay in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reproduction toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous applications , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bit ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects covered a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ stem cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosing , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of which had previously received anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug contained in a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer had no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time and deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in patients , breast@@ feeding or before starting treatment low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the drug was no longer treated more effectively than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , and that unlike other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , drugs must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment can be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in the patients no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ron count is increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; whereas a si@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardi@@ al incidents in the indicated patient &apos;s collective are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child can testify . &quot;
&quot; in front of the treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the per@@ si@@ veness and ability to serve machinery .
below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most remarkable ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quick re@@ versi@@ bly and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the co@@ generation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ mit@@ es and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ colon@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ant receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by 106 patients in two mon@@ oton@@ ous un@@ blind@@ ed trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; when recording into the study , 64 % of patients had a negative overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 In the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma centr@@ ation took off in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or crossover binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

member states must ensure that the owner of the permit for the market launch will provide the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
&quot; in patients with normal blood fer@@ rous values , complications may occur in patients with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
injection may also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor if they have received appropriate guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; in administration , Ab@@ se@@ amed was treated as an injection into a vein within the framework of a study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either switched to se@@ amed or still got E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled Ab@@ se@@ amed with those received by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from an an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients ) .
&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this will not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which manufactures se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical staff in all member states including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned major operational procedures which demand a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion compounds is expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient via or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ess exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose that is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and epilep@@ sy .
the available clinical results indicate that patients with initially low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and consequences may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose that is required for the control of the epilep@@ sy symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the prec@@ urs@@ or value of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid figure of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased from the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid figure is increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid figure increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an response to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ uts is required should be obtained in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively charged 300 I.@@ U. / kg in each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke of stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from an aut@@ olog@@ ous or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after monthly and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden effect loss , defined as reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ appeal ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid value , considering the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ oc@@ y@@ te index ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be weigh@@ ed for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit , which is attribut@@ able to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required for controlling an@@ emia and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions . &quot;
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically detected cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of kidney failure . &quot;
&quot; in tumor patient treatment , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can pers@@ ist for patients with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ level limit of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
&quot; if ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose is adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro investigations of tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( brain bleeding , brain inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , lung em@@ bol@@ ism , ret@@ ina thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; irrespective of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after re@@ peti@@ tive blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically extracted ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and , in terms of amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to the end@@ ogen@@ ous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of ancient patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ blast@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 further hem@@ og@@ blast@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 M@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ ch@@ ial carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 M@@ amm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ ch@@ ial tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors , and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ blast@@ osis . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ omas , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than with controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ser@@ um levels are much lower than the ser@@ um levels that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( frac@@ ture fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis patients , who were treated three years with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of frac@@ ture fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approxim@@ ate the 20@@ times the weekly dose recommended by humans , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished fat body weight , to delay the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in mortality mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro diagnostics with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uns@@ afe significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a printed label , so if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; • If you have suffered a heart attack or stroke during one month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ) . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal ( vascular disease of the locom@@ oti@@ ves ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with se@@ amed , it can come to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms with further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may perform regular blood tests in order to regularly check the number of blood tok@@ ens during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with se@@ amed before starting the therapy . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tik@@ per@@ verse ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia after monthly and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given through inj@@ ections into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of dying may be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood arm@@ uth with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of kidney failure . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular happ@@ enings , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular happ@@ enings ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed appears as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances the tumour can neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is about to be treated , you should examine the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before treatment starts and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been used / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are using C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need specific blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means of building the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia is applied to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg will be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ecting Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral bleeding , stroke , transi@@ ent circulation disorders of the brain , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;
&quot; eyel@@ ids and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ ck ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching , heat @-@ feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated bleeding it can - irrespective of the treatment with se@@ amed - can lead to a blood drop formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular happ@@ enings ) .
treatment with se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood testing after surgery ( postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular happ@@ enings ) when your output level is too high

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle bones ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture such as H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms that occur in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta may be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
&quot; as the agent in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who have recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta has been tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with elderly women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment which contains indications how to use the medicine as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ cl@@ asta across the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indications in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with ren@@ al function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data is missing for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene , should be weigh@@ ed with appropriate preventive dental treatment before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which were associated with the decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently created hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion site , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area occ@@ ured , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including lin@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ op@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in one with A@@ cl@@ asta and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compens@@ ated . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ed@@ dy body .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new fluid fr@@ actions ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of fluid frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; impact on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the shr@@ ink@@ age by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose bone biop@@ sies were taken out of the pel@@ vis . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to placebo an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone architecture .
&quot; bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the Beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients during periods of study . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment increased compared to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.@@ 3 % at the enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed compared to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as resp@@ onder@@ s at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate during an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ ex @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma tor@@ ch quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life hours t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of met@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible nitrogen @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min with the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; because of severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest un@@ let@@ ally effective intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.9 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; studies in dogs were given individual doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um @-@ calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indications in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , aug@@ mented on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk management plan The owner of the permit for the transport company obli@@ ges to carry out the studies and the additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all of the following by the CH@@ MP authorized versions of the R@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human drug use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on security , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk management ) was achieved . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a member of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is made un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by rein@@ forcing the bone structure again , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , giving the bone reg@@ ain strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have other medicines or have been used / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , known to them that they damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and beverages , you are worried that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a vein .
&quot; if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; if there is A@@ cl@@ asta for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood during the inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . if you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to the first inf@@ usion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , however , after the subsequent inf@@ usions are less frequent . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects you listed are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic inter@@ mitt@@ ent , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for the placement of smoking in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the placement of smoking showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he noted the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory system . ng The complete listing of the side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is the package insert . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it increases the risk of depression and among other things can cause su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts among a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin , or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight cuts
&quot; medicines used in patients who need health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I &gt; 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of the treatment is out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions may occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other nearby individuals may indicate that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms , and seek emergency medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur . &quot;
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ct or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

&quot; patients with obesity have been studied , and in addition to 38@@ 00 patients in further indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects observed in placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and for accompanying metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG With the evaluation of side effects , the following frequencies are basically laid : &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of individuals were administered by up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ emia .
&quot; weight reduction following a year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia , referring to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 ; -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . E@@ IM &quot;
9 weight reduction and more risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with a bas@@ eline value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference between the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and explained about 50 % by weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; the influence of food : he subjects , who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the in@@ toxic@@ ating state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed a 67 % increase in C@@ MA@@ x and increased by 48 % in the case of food supply . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and one by 43 % lower AU@@ D than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age spectrum of 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and one by 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of adverse adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which appeared in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered possibly relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress appears to be associated with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so that no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycl@@ amen . &quot;

the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) can not be applied . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied at 289 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity towards stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one mirrors - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos are used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin , and in which metals are un@@ suitable for contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcomes study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been performed .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers will be re @-@ monitored as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ch pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be guided by the clinical evaluation until the preliminary result of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can arise from fat deposits and in some cases be linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin or dual combination therapy with insulin , are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ an , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on disorders of vision ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &quot;
the frac@@ tures calculated was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is ab@@ duc@@ ted ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fo@@ lic growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( available from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a temporary change in the turbine and the re@@ fraction of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on AL@@ T asc@@ ents were similar to placebo , but more rarely than in placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an effect on activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated , PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose appreciation in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and a minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcomes study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma normally 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to efficacy corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma elimination rating of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , however , the rates of the oral clearance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fo@@ lic growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epithel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ ds led to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ tures calculated was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the goal with regard to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation of the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women showed . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to other human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ aph@@ an may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the package template ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an out@@ weigh the risk of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ af@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly due to an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ aph@@ an in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosing or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before traveling , which go beyond several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients about other drugs taken by them .

&quot; the push button moves outw@@ ards while you turn the sealing cap • The scale under the button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the cap , right next to the dosing schedule • Not@@ ate the highest number you can see on the button bar • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap simply forward or backward , until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise insulin is out of the injection needle , and the set dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , perform the following steps by : &quot;
then remove the sealing cap and reset it so that the 0 of the met@@ ering mark is opposite .
make sure to squee@@ ze only during the injection on the push button . • Ke@@ ep the pressure button down completely until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystal de@@ composition , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ ums ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still higher than 6 m@@ g. per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased at once daily 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months there may still be toxic attacks ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic or other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medicine ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood in the last three measurements were below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there is possibly an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia in diseases which have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present in the g@@ ular node and / or a arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid level still amounts to 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents There are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or compens@@ ated heart failure treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ acid medicines , it is possible to come to acute rheum@@ atism during treatment , because of the reduction of the ser@@ um acid test , ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during clinical trials in Phase 3 , mild symptoms of liver function were observed in Feb@@ u@@ bi@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the Feb@@ ur@@ a@@ stat@@ ure treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no exchange rate studies carried out at Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll lens ( a hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; subjects were associated with an increase in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250@@ mg 2 times daily with an increase in Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without requiring a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ o@@ ost@@ at or at the same time required other active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous capture of an ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change of AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ u@@ bi@@ ost@@ at could be determined . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ bi@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated simultaneously with Col@@ chic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies In the open long term renewal studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to the long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and were reported in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thesia , show@@ y EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin dy@@ eing , skin les@@ ion , burst concentration in the blood , decrease of T@@ SH concentrations in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the reaction chain Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhibit@@ or located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the decrease of ser@@ um acid acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um Cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in percentage reduction in ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years showed that the continuous reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ ums ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients , no treatment was required ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ ums , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the peak no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ A / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.2 % ) in the open long term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma @-@ centr@@ ation time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased by 10 mg to 120 m@@ g. of dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 m@@ g. a rise in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage reduction in ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 m@@ g. daily .
&quot; plasma cutting of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ut@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of Feb@@ u@@ bi@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine than unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ bi@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g api@@ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g 2.00 / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver dysfunction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

&quot; the owner of the permit for transportation has to make sure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application &apos;s application is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine , an updated R@@ MP can be presented to risk management systems for human drug use with the next Peri@@ odic Safety update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk management • within 60 days of achievement of important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk management ) • at the request of E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the acid concentration through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC low , cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms is reached . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC ) &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , • If you have a cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency or had or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated due to a high ur@@ inary acid concentration in a result of a cancer condition or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder , in which too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood is ) treated . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out is cancelled before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .

&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 can already be used separately in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , that is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ab@@ norm@@ alities , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en , as well as sour stir . &quot;
&quot; in patients with acet@@ wa@@ al hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be carefully followed to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth since there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by g@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these were severe and required a hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to potential mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms , which indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , there were rarely ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ op@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regim@@ en contains mainly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give evidence , whether using a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by treating physicians is decisive for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but carry the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate Food and Be@@ verages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without affecting clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applied during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at allow no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) appeared in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals may result . &quot;

after 15 @-@ week treatment the mean ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 12 % vs .

the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III trials , the moderate asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % in the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3,@@ 2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the p@@ ups of the BM@@ D of ver@@ teb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
&quot; it consisted of two place @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily for either 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ verages on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate at women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before absorption of a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
bio@@ availability was reduced to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ation of the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution trials in rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily divided into soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted through the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems is affected . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the treatment of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nonetheless likely that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bones is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent the transplan@@ tation of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , with the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
&quot; trem@@ ors , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) as well as sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ ular bottom with &quot; &quot; B 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clinical relevance of the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dosage should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in an individual case and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
&quot; after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendation - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - Migration from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; transplan@@ tation In adult patients , who are transferred to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initi@@ als dose of 0.10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ als dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine level , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f at the change@@ over from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also be controlled after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ Adjust@@ ment , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels of seb@@ um in the blood 20 ng / ml do not exceed .
&quot; in clinical practice , the lower blood level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood is usually in the blood of 5 - 20 ng / ml and ne@@ uro @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects resulting in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or super@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data are still available for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a degradation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided , or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to significant fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f one could observe a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trophy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , hydr@@ ation and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose are included in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or decrease blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - Blood Mir@@ ror is recommended in the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as the Macro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased or@@ ally bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal absorption . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or reduce the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lowers the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ eption actions must be particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended to possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;

the side @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is common in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in connection with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on a molecular level should be medi@@ ated by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inside . &quot;
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of signal trans@@ duction because of the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells ( like Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ Inter@@ fer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection occurred within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Group ( N = 237 ) 32.@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 males ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) deaths . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared , in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) deaths occurred . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared in combination with Basi@@ li@@ xim@@ ab antibody injection , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 214 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 212 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference of treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ ag@@ raf@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % discount interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % discount interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; 175 l@@ ung@@ transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ as transplan@@ t and used in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies revealed the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in case of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported about 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ant compared to 3@@ 8.0 % among C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were mig@@ rated to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ t transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ - syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower . &quot;
&quot; pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients , simultaneously receiving a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t , which received a random@@ ised trial tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ als dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after colon@@ os@@ copy showed an actual survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row magni@@ fication , additional gift of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ists D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ eous humor ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ ating value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly through the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , hydr@@ ation and ede@@ ma . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( due to the lack of factor VIII conditioned , con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor of VIII @-@ deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise manufactured so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood pressure drops was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ance may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of Adv@@ ate throughout the European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency depending on the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor of VIII @-@ activity in the appropriate period is not to sink below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment course , proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosage speed should be directed after the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII . Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occurrence of ( low@@ g@@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences concerning the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ Rs in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who were all patients with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop of the co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ type occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , no one of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed with a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients en@@ rolled about the appearance of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;

the activation factor VIII works as a factor factor for the activation factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( basic value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , so that the registration holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the Company with@@ drew its application for approval for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue , which links the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and leans ) of it . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot cause infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 @-@ gene existing in the human body , normally contributes to restoring damaged DNA and kill cells when the DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the field of under@@ growth , bone and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP provided the answers to the questions asked by the company , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP issued a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours is beneficial for patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient , is harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; modified ingredient release means that the tablets are so combined , that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over several hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cor@@ rupted . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms which were reported from the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were over the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported that the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze included a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in patients suffering from an angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , or hyper@@ tension ( caused by cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but swal@@ low it up ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term waste may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attribut@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed that the treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ct in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their levels . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences between the patients treated with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo treated patients could be found regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies have not increased the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies have not always been transferred to humans and , due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be informed , however , that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness that can lead to an impair@@ ment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ mental pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard met@@ rics of flight performance , including strengthening subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ op@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al retinal swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the application in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose case study conducted with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure after the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety hygiene , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual constitu@@ ents , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms , preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous drug P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; tell your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache , or a rein@@ forcement of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you use aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
the use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or lowers the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you forgot the dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you listed are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing not , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ettle r@@ ash and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , num@@ b@@ ness , num@@ b@@ ness , num@@ b@@ ness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values was also very rare . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution to intake . &quot;
&quot; for children at the age of one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; in total , A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness was measured by identifying the changes in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the thread , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) of 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been eff@@ ected and resum@@ ed .
&quot; in case of persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended for continuous treatment during the allergy time . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , when taking a@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was head@@ ache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose trial , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses which was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) administered more than ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was detected . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard met@@ rics of flight performance , including strengthening subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ drop and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of eti@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; since hi@@ stam@@ ine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ anti@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of tri@@ angles at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies involving anti @-@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose case study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety hygiene , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ess , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ cordless , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with a@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine metabol@@ ise and experience a higher level of substance ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking a@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 who came into question for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily dis@@ astro@@ us dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials do not interfere with psych@@ omot@@ oric . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a gain of alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance , nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ drop and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively l@@ essen the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of tri@@ angles at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis that are fully metabol@@ ised .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In several single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to the recommended doses of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded . &quot;

&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to take once daily in the mouth , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose trial , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied for 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;

&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tabl@@ ette proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the acquisition and formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including strengthening subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( adul@@ thood 2 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ant from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ enges with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for inhal@@ ation were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined on pedi@@ atric patients , however , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting pot revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;

the overall incidence of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the placebo group in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group .
&quot; inf@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) were reported in small children between 6 and 23 months . &quot;
no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed in an additional study .
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis , depending on the duration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively l@@ essen the load caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ drew its application for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is supposed to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a body est@@ ran@@ de ) was puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is caused by the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for taking the capsules , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV lot in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to cure , but can also delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug induced by low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared to 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had not previously taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml under A@@ gener@@ ase after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug reinforced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger decrease in viral load along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are just as degra@@ ded as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take ast@@ er@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis or immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by a relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was given at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for the transport of renewable energy across the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster@@ y of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic Cap@@ sules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic Cap@@ sules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ants in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on im@@ parti@@ ality and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic Cap@@ sules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 m@@ g. twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and furthermore represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with previously existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are confused with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ generic ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) , A@@ gener@@ ase should be set aside when a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases where drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addi@@ cts , such as prolonged an@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es occur . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and furthermore represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already occupies St. John &apos;s wort , the amber mirror and , if possible , check the virus load and add the St John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % reduced when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
&quot; a dosage recommendation for con@@ current administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to monitor closely monitoring since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ate@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with flu@@ enza in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may lower the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed since a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ pen@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous addition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase of side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with an@@ asis in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value which was observed once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can possibly result in interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interact . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ate@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can occur to erectile dysfunction . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme inhibit@@ ors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can result in the degradation of the plasma gr@@ ille of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ cardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase may increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of ap@@ ron with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is heavily dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to increase the plas@@ ticity of the plasma at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; a more common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic ase may not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma gas in 3 to 4 cases .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low neg@@ ligence of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently given , as the am@@ pr@@ avi@@ r dose is adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in the absence of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of pregnant rats , administered by the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the down@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurring early and rarely lead to treatment break@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the consumption of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ effects mentioned below are taken from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of am@@ em@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and thor@@ o@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral no pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ches ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually slightly until moder@@ ately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared spontane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients , which received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K levels observed in patients who received ants together with low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive actions must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral Gag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein pre @-@ stages with the result of an formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral agents , which received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a four @-@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ate could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not appear pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross @-@ resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , c@@ love @-@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there is currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral in@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which treated with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ flow threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ fired am@@ em@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generative solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on these data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ fired &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bon@@ ded am@@ pr@@ avi@@ r , representing the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when given simultaneously with ate@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio @-@ compliant than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effects of a ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without con@@ serving Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was neither mut@@ ation nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant hep@@ atic toxic@@ ity has been observed in clinical trials , either during the administration of am@@ generations or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with age of 4 showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus jug@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic Cap@@ sules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should take place in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be depos@@ ited in duration 27 when a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug addi@@ cts such as prolonged anti retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
&quot; a dosage recommendation for con@@ current administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to monitor closely monitoring since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with flu@@ enza in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed since a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ pen@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ cardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the absence of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the interference in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive actions must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1@@ µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the therapy optimisation of PI pre@@ treated children should be considered the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ fired &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when given simultaneously with ate@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effects of a ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) exposure to people after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot;

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with age of 4 showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation routes are not yet fully developed in juven@@ iles , such as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;

&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ generic ase solution for inser@@ ting was not covered in either PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to stop ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) , A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as prolonged anti retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es occur . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk for humans is unknown . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col cannot be applied during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of pregnant rats , administered by the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished 55 body weight during the down@@ time . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • With short bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week to a maximum of 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is applied to the affected areas of skin , so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo had been performed either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % in the placebo group treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application site of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ rac@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continuing to continue until all visible f@@ ences have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the cleaned , infected skin area , until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a balance should take place between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a balance should be made between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ famili@@ arity was carried out , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with one to the circum@@ cis@@ ions of leading stri@@ k@@ tur . &quot;
&quot; when using i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , even under proper application severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed that have necess@@ itated treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous scar@@ ce treatments for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital and peripher@@ y , no clinical experience has been available . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates an increased rate of slope reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the removal of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ae . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after finishing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot;
&quot; after regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed approximately 12 weeks after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of over 36 months after treatment , other appropriate therapeutic forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have any clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses at anatom@@ ic locations outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands support the effectiveness of this application . therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take over intensity during the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions are causing great dis@@ comfort to the patient , or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions reported a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not have direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de @-@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of treating f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and possibly possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
adverse events reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side @-@ effects are shown below .
the most common possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects reported by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ ori@@ ation / de@@ fl@@ es ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the assessment of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ aling and em@@ ulation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients , the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen radi@@ ated completely ; this was in case of 20 % of 105 patients with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years indicate that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment times of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment times .
&quot; the permitted indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) . &quot;
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for four months in the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in case of der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk to humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the effect @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people , even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( after ) ● Surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a commonly encountered and slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; if untreated , it can lead to de@@ formations , especially in the face - therefore early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are harsh areas of the skin , which occur in people exposed to sunlight during their previous lives . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in flat ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations before you start treatment , please inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Leave your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void the contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;

&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , with increased presence of pre @-@ skin con@@ stri@@ ctions swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when re@@ traction of the fores@@ kin can be expected . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medicines serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital area during infection with genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) will perform . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od passes into the breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment varies according to F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin place with the fen@@ war@@ ts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
&quot; men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin need to withdraw the fores@@ kin each day and wash the skin area beneath it ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; What must you consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks each week , 5 days a week , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

&quot; if your skin re@@ acts to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to produce a blue spot faster , or she may cause de@@ ple@@ tion . &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can experience it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas that you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , lighter skin reactions take place within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is cancelled . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sc@@ aling , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application site ( bru@@ te , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , s@@ wollen nose , flu or flu ) , inflammation of the eyel@@ id , throat pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , red@@ ness , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a proven diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the not neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements more difficult , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with revi@@ ving devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration in order to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly investigated by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ MP concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , review and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , will observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to inf@@ usion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a proven diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can increase if the patient dies off every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies to larv@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment , careful treatment must be cau@@ tious . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before starting the inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of light or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; 3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) , as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the pre @-@ balanced response occurred . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to larv@@ ae over the breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is not breast@@ feeding . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma observed during Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children undes@@ irable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe form of prescription and a duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a severe delay in patients aged under 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , there were no antibodies prov@@ able by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ to@@ sis ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it had never been to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with l@@ acked to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of undes@@ irable drug interactions even if the occurrence of undes@@ irable drug interactions coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received additional 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table . &quot;
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume continued to increase propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first four weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed that remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in general an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed . &quot;
a one year open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma &apos;s safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe form of the course and 4 with the middle course form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed following the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe delay form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe delay only limited or no progress in cognitive development were detected . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma met@@ ering schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ages is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will assess any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to the patients affected by older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety hygiene , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the holder of the authorisation for the transport has to complete the following program of study , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this tab will have long @-@ term security and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small quantity or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction occurred on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently been taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
hints for handling - Th@@ inner and application The concentrate on the production of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can increase if the patient dies off every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; however , some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history occurred however severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • stomach pain • skin r@@ ash • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • In@@ cre@@ ased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the inf@@ usion &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if th@@ inning under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions occurred . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of pier@@ cing bottles to be dil@@ uted according to body weight .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to decrease side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood is altered or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , ab@@ ated or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to share .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to fit into cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural melan@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived on average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transit of A@@ lim@@ ta across the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is extracted from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant plat@@ epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma , except for over@@ weight plate epithel@@ ial Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after conclusion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dosage and after each third stroke cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a full blood image should be created before each gift , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood bil@@ let or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous h@@ ay therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or more , compared to patients aged under 65 years an increased side effect . &quot;
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients . &quot;
&quot; the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ al limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of sever@@ ity of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mark@@ ers and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ew has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - number of cells once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes , and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia were be@@ amed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed need to be instruc@@ ted to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who performed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ duc@@ tile room , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally if this ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment be@@ - G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed separation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high doses . &quot;
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with decent an@@ tim@@ es@@ ol@@ ites , severe defects of birth are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used during pregnancy , except when necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment commen@@ cement to obtain advice regarding the locking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed passes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; side effects Frequ@@ encies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontan@@ eity ) . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients were random@@ ized P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed with sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 of three P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) in Phase 2 , excluding neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output levels of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSC@@ LC , random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC , random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine . &quot;

&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ li@@ acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies , P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed appears as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ act@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin for cis@@ pl@@ atin in patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural stem was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a displacement of the lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC resulted in a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with ALI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 283 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival was in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 6,@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel is similar . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin combined with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see below table . &quot;
&quot; CI = Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al intervals ; IT@@ T = int@@ ents @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority , with a total cost interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ under@@ age limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ t@@ transfer@@ s@@ f@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0,@@ 002 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients also needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0,0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed after administration as a mon@@ otherap@@ ic were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usi@@ - ones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is re @-@ found within 24 hours following the application , unchanged in the urine . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed has a total size of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min , and the half @-@ life in plasma amounts to 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , who had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ generation / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epithel@@ ial tissue ) . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality of the product . &quot;
&quot; it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no loss of weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot dissi@@ p@@ ate some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of fats that fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg after one year recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg for taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no more relevant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair , chair , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , exit o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine and low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ted , in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( see section 4.6 and 4.8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic may be appropriate . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tions possible in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a mal@@ dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of side @-@ effects known after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a 15 @-@ day period of normal weight and over@@ weight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of the systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ at@@ inhibit@@ ing properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect relies on co@@ valent bonds in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in rest of the ga@@ stro and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , inhi@@ bit the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 cover the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ o , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of the course ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those students who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral application of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeutic dosage , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be spor@@ adic and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimum systemic res@@ or@@ ted dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified which represented approxim@@ ate 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data does not reveal any particular risk to humans . &quot;

&quot; how to limit your cal@@ orie and fet@@ al surface , find out more helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or do not contain any fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in combination with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk mal@@ nour@@ ished companions ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to get used to your body in the new eating habits , you start before the first capsule collection with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; nutritional di@@ aries are effective , as you can easily compreh@@ end what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits . &quot;
&quot; to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; • Take a fat reduction in order to decrease the likel@@ ihood of mal@@ nour@@ ished accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more , before you start taking the capsules . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you listed are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and thus develop that fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment course , as you might not have reduced the fat content in your diet at this time . &quot;
&quot; learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions , which you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Leave your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; reduce the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a high @-@ fat main dish or a substantial fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ness , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

excess weight has influence on your health and increases the risk of creating various serious illnesses such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart diseases • stroke • Pain cancer diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is appropriate for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional @-@ related symptoms . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to place realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Sinn@@ fully is a food diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of further information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fat levels and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are the moderate release for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information to the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the agent maintains the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; with chemotherapy , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ us showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate release for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ us showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ op@@ us ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in severe emet@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy because of cancer and for preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately emet@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ us to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting caused by a strong em@@ powered chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon level , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute id after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised in the simultaneous offering of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or that may tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; besides chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous application of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , dy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , fluor@@ o@@ e@@ tin , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies may not be applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly associated with al@@ op@@ us , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and sor@@ eness ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ drug interactions . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective treatment with a alo@@ xi@@ al over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 25@@ mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study showed a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ powered chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with exc@@ essi@@ vely emet@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy and the study with highly ex@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the mean average ( ± SD ) average ( ± SD ) was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached total exposure to three consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after releasing 0.75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys , and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were recovered about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination and average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only by ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 Pre@@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 300,000 of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , end@@ ocr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is low for the human being . &quot;
the owner of this permit for the transport must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the medicine approved within the scope of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the approval of the drug provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; during a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue has damages , furthermore the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood have been ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data to determine the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was applied ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up again in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how the medicine is immune to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ und@@ ations ( cracks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistance Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not work against this kind of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wound , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were combined with skin wound , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections which were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ z@@ ations , dis@@ ap@@ ses or stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. to the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary open wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration if no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in people after top@@ ical application on s@@ me@@ ared skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Accor@@ ding to the simultaneous oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ran@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after top@@ ical application of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate with regards to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin the administration of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / completed is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation on the date of the date , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; manner Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ a@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ a@@ eri@@ anus ) by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ a@@ eri@@ anus . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om that differ from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Center .
&quot; by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partly block P @-@ binding inter@@ acting and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , a consultation by experts should be as@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; no differences were detected in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ran@@ am@@ ulin opposite to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ran@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on to intact skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before meditation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under minor involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymph@@ oma test resp@@ . in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure to people ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , at oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity detected . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the permit for the transport must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( Version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the transport company is oblig@@ ated to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Drug Products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odic Safety update report . &quot;
&quot; to show irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment consists of looking at one of these areas , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gaz@@ ever@@ band unless your doctor has advised you to un@@ cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum pou@@ ch containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ enta is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after dosing the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ enta can only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two cans can be completed . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; since 1996 , Ambi@@ rix has the same components as the vaccine @-@ approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and the vaccine @-@ approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children will be administered within a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults were also used as proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B. &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ enta was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient may not be applied in patients , who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals with the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals .
&quot; the basic plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ H@@ AV surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ H@@ AV @-@ antibody ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody values are the same size as after vacc@@ ination , with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis A vaccine , need vacc@@ ination as protection since they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , containing 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ination doses may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication in the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected in an exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous form , as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that no sufficient immune response is possible . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ age , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ cial and preser@@ v@@ ative vacc@@ ination formulation . &quot;
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 imp@@ etus at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ eness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ enta at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix were over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ eness was comparable to per pro@@ tape ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix in comparison with 36.@@ 2 % among the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and efficacy was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of impact , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per test volume , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the percentage of imp@@ etus , which reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ enta or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen in the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ ity responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study from 1 to 11 year @-@ old one month after the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the imp@@ fl@@ es received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in people aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ ity response observed in this study was comparable to those detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies were comparable to the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vacc@@ ination scheme 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ usal to investigate any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state charging is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted by means of viral food and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as swimming in waters contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before serving both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prescribed dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vaccine series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ enta can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take / take additional medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been administered or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) has been administered / has or that is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ enta is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , aspir@@ ant gest@@ ures or breast@@ feeding women are not given , except it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ itated doses ) : • Pain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) : • swelling of the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Tr@@ unk • gastro@@ intestinal ail@@ ments
&quot; further side effects , which were reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than one case per 10,000 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include local limited or extensive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or cre@@ eping , swelling of the eye section and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cies , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ percep@@ tions such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants running , &quot; Multiple S@@ cl@@ erosis , loss of sensation or movement capacity of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and sti@@ ff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; impot@@ ence inflamm@@ ations of some blood vessels dis@@ comfort or illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rhe@@ a and stomach pain , liver function tests increased prop@@ ens@@ ity to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( blue spots ) , caused by the decrease of the amount of blood . &quot;
23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package template .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data known since obtaining the first permit for the market , CH@@ MP res@@ igned from the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix has been marketed only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ites may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered over a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ites could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medicine , that is , without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; also may lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste @-@ like , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; ammon@@ ites were approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine occurred . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , an indication exists for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ emic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy consists in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ az@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ ORG@@ PS tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ BLA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma associated with caution .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ ORG@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous transl@@ ates of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it became a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ ORG@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ate dosis , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ ant@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occ@@ ured in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old baby with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound that is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for every gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
it is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative path@@ ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney , with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and metabol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2@@ g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dosage of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a concentration or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable .
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma stage were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ assy effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ ORG@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low or swal@@ low the tablets , or patients with swal@@ low distur@@ ban@@ ces ) or a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ bush or a nose son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ az@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before the birth , there were les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ ORG@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ate dosis , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ ant@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat
on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for every gram absorbed sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral dosage of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ule form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine on a probe , AM@@ ORG@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate after the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ ORG@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ ORG@@ PS , as the drug may go over into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases also confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , follow @-@ up of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or your hospital &apos;s emergency response for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the dose of AM@@ ORG@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ ORG@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ ORG@@ PS distributed on same single doses or@@ ally or over a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ le ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate out of the tank . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules out of the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; st@@ - lifting &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI , a higher dose is administered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and additionally they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or revenge ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , other her@@ ds@@ ins or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the distribution of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ) with an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further consequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ted bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt will be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to decrease the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ated and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the Bol@@ us dose is administered rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the dose of 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion @-@ dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second over@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is required and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ d@@ dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after administration of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of lower @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
&quot; • severe in@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients , or against brain @-@ ins • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial end@@ o@@ cardi@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI patients with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most of the hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of arter@@ ial points occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again achieved prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with plat@@ el@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are inadequate in terms of impact on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de @-@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years were more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of detection , reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years were more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to both the cataly@@ tic centre and the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ ungs@@ region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on t@@ ann@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with ser@@ um of patients with ser@@ um induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ str@@ ated thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had not indu@@ ce a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI has been performed in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST le@@ verage inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST le@@ ak@@ age inf@@ ar@@ ction . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , upper th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin does not work effectively .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter time of operation than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the modification of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin c@@ ots . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the abdom@@ en area . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin delivery , insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( producer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active ingredient of the insulin they are used and can therefore change at changing the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ co pyram@@ ids , tri@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympathy such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no difference between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin &apos;s l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine trans@@ forms into the human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed out of clinical trials known adverse drug interactions , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ or , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection point within the injection range , a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated with a intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ons ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person or treated with intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ eing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( in particular through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed propor@@ tion@@ ale glu@@ cos@@ a effect in the therapeutic range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ately proportional increase of the glu@@ cos@@ a effect , just like human@@ oids . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ a effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ emic control is achieved , just like with normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was achieved with a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than with normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ emic control such as normal insulin , which is given 2 hours before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before starting the meal in comparison with human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
