<seg id="5">"B. wirls thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental disorder where the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or the enamel tablets in patients with difficulty preparing the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than neurotransmitters, is effective in order to activate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of abilify, preventing recurrence of symptoms, was studied in three trials over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol in another study, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of abilify injection solution was compared with a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment was investigated."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the melt tablettes and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients that received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg, a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness compared to the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when used to treat bipolar disorder, abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to 74 weeks, abilify prevented recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Drugs (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. to approve the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the onset or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions prescribed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including akocele and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia arising during treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when a patient treated with abilify symptoms and symptoms of a late-dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or indefinite high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with convulsions in the anamnesis or at conditions related to seizures associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with aripiprazol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazol had an increased mortality risk compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagic and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6-inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazol by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'poor' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduction should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorpan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethmorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be applied during pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative effect on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with aria, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of eps 19% in patients was placebo treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15,1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>

<seg id="67">"in another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters appeared, did not result from medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of aria prazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partially agonistic effect on dopamine and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergigen and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"at the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11c-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the putstream."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a semi-operidol-controlled trial, 52% of the respondents had a response to the study medication, similar to both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study agents including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressive rates scale, showed significantly greater improvement than with Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was observed among significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a performance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazol also showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania as lithium or Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly discussed over 2 weeks not on lithium or valproar monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>

<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylic ation of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationary period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up analysis for pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study of subjects with different cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety hygiene, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dose-dependant adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchystem cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinds-carcinomas and combined adrenal rinds / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the average Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol were no more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solution."</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed up again in more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how the medicine is immune to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected laundations (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against this kind of infections."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>

<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wound, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were combined with skin wound, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections which were detectable or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small lazations, disapses or stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials of secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosom that differ from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the PeptidyltransferaseCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptidyltransfer, partly block P-binding interacting and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, a consultation by experts should be aspired."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were detected in the in-vitro activity of Retranamulin opposite to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, upper thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin does not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisine differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter time of operation than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, Apidra has been studied in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where insulin does not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the modification of the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin cots."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines, which can affect blood glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the abdomen area."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced Gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin delivery, insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active strength, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin requirement."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active ingredient of the insulin they are used and can therefore change at changing the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood glucose activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disco pyramids, trioamin-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympathy such as betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin, the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation can be weakened or absent."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no difference between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin's lulisine transforms into the human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed below are listed out of clinical trials known adverse drug interactions, grouped by system organclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated)."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, lightheadedness, headache, nausea and palpitations."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"Lipodystrophy is foamed to continuously change the injection point within the injection range, a lipoystrophy can occur at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagons (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person or treated with intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glueing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (in particular through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin lulisin showed proportionale glucosa effect in the therapeutic range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionately proportional increase of the glucosa effect, just like humanoids."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosa effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved, just like with normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"in 2 minutes before the meal, insulin lulisin was achieved with a better postprandiale control than with normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"insulin-lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control such as normal insulin, which is given 2 hours before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before starting the meal in comparison with human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B)."</seg>
