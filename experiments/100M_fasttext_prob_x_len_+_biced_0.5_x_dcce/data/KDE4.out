the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available easier .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Add Settings ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules may be on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on Extras crashes . then you can view the page , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the view filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the right displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ ating representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . to facilitate navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have reasonable colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view of color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles are to be used ( whereby , hence , representation errors occur due to the signs of the Tre@@ ating ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for performance algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is propor@@ tionally to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of space losses by frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as quad@@ r@@ atic as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branch . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view on area . instead , a rou@@ gh@@ out pattern is drawn to the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can define the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title page of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a screen@@ shot to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box file name of the picture , specify if the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; to view the file size of the image , see if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;

&quot; in the Fol@@ der folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy original images to copy the original images to the gallery .
use the commentary box to use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provide easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under the window navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , where you can change browser and operating system ID for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only to certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; changes the password in M@@ SI@@ E for sites that reject access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser ID to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
sites that do not conform to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser ID is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry , set up ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual . &quot;
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ Style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Extras Website . you can make the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML , check out if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponding , all found errors are displayed . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are correctly displayed by all browsers . &quot;
&quot; allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets included in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; document included . with valid &amp; CSS , your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser being used . &quot;
&quot; check the links on your page on re@@ direc@@ ts and faul@@ ty links . recur@@ sively , all links are checked on the website . &quot;
here you place the addresses of the servers for the verification of your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets .

&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ . together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate , and correct your photos . the handling capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ p@@ ected ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ p@@ ected ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; it is a project that is supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ desk ; visit the homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization ; to learn more .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name folder or click the folder icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; will also use as an alpha library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by adding a point in front of the sub@@ folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste will not have photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw @-@ mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ . together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digital cameras , which support a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras , also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . Exif
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ tization is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to make the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tised ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; themselves . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind icon view is displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure the settings in the settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that were stored by &amp; digi@@ came are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the destination album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , right click on the album and edit the album properties . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections from the collection , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
&quot; the buttons are oldest , average , new : they set the date on the oldest , the latest image or that of the album . to do this , the average of the pictures will be calculated from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; that will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album template , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fiers in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change the settings digit@@ al@@ .@@ Please select the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can view all the features associated with &amp; digi@@ . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and edit ... select a manual on how to edit your photos . with image processing , you can view and change your photos . &quot;
&quot; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . for this , and how you can adapt it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; it should be noted that after processing by other image processing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; the easiest is to click the thumb@@ nail to view and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; delete , it is moved into the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer by &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer real del@@ e@@ tion , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organis@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; using either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos marked with this key@@ word are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby , you can organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords &quot; ; you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; or an existing key@@ word , and then choose the new key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new key@@ word after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word will be key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears , giving you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in a tree at a time . &quot;
&quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking the right mouse button , and edit key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , click the right mouse button and select the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to take advantage of the functionality with key@@ word , you first have to add your photos with key@@ word . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; click on the preview of the images and select the key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can get a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the keywords menu . the menu only shows you the tags assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time beam view shows a chron@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower right angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all the related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search doesn &apos;t find anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you will find a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the results will be used in view My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search again , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit searches , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit it as an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group , or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others about logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... At least , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ GH@@ TS . &quot;
&quot; the smaller the difference between two picture sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . the smaller the difference between two picture sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar Entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the results selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
&quot; sket@@ ch : free hand @-@ hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ach ; find the suitable pictures . even here , a threshold value can be set . &quot;
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ p@@ ated ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , also raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ tly added from the context menu .
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a series of images . if you navigate p@@ airing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the areas for the comparison . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can spot on the crossed arrows . in order to switch the visible area of the picture , you must click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom control below the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom into the image . this happens in both images when you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital asset management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process , following the picture taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores , performs a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , and re @-@ use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , servic@@ ing and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , ass@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you do not need to save a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; . the approach of storing the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you need to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like version@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for that content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata storage option in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; to activate it . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do it &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; they provide a Metad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , inscri@@ ptions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work . &quot;
&quot; let us now use keywords , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or by categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it becomes &amp; digi@@ tised ; automatically add the tree for you or paste the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historic period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who regard your photos , the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motif that you moved has to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images to web galleries , then these inscri@@ ptions will not tell you a second time for publishing . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation already drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may be used . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s name . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; for private individuals , this protection is very important to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate failure , disk failure , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ vation , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics for a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these pru@@ dent ones must be handled and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks may be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . so the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control . &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturers &apos; manufacturers will include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disks : flo@@ ppy disks . &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ cos hold the longest when you run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate increases dramatically . some errors identified by S@@ MAR@@ T are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make a much difference in devices with chips and high @-@ speed processes , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current tips is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy injection and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage can be used to your computer , you should be aware that even all peripher@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and order the system ordered . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go into the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; these solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically adjusted and with large companies , a backup and a distributed memory are included in the offer . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a lower level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for Linux , but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses on not@@ ebooks and 46 % in the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open Source File Systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are going towards 10 megapixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even D@@ SLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous such as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ste@@ els are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neigh@@ b@@ oured house , into your office or the like . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two points : one of the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
save important images directly after saving them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , saved in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memories , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be compatible with the current system . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means that it always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely distributed as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . however , a problem is that this format was adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
the Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this is perhaps one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block@@ quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera screen , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw file . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a multi @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you res@@ ume the images with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze again , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised ; to get . in the adding of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it off . a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file properties and photo information , which is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab displays internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer notes , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ came ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ came ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; choose . once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then select Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . these images have not been downloaded yet from &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case , the new images are displayed with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the buttons All to download or download selected images , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums will be displayed in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must select them first and delete the selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to re @-@ establish photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ p@@ ous ; -@@ album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera bug , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made in the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use a different date format than standard format , for example , in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further custom@@ iz@@ ations , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ p@@ ated ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording , to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; this is used to automatically upload sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in that case it stores &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the picture selection is done , &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated ; you where the images should be loaded up . a folder drop dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term used in this document . thus , a position that can be indicated in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot later where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ach ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that Ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ SLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic allocation . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign@@ atures of ha@@ iry coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages , and you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can set the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ g ; fix if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the relevant IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected for downloading from the camera &apos;s site . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to give the photo that offers the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is a photo agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of other &amp; quot ; providers &quot; . &quot; if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC campaigns store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that metadata is permanently contained in the image , and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ected ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tised ; imported without loss . &quot;
&quot; images saved as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page lists all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is located in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ p@@ ated ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to specify , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam , folder folder that has none of these extensions , managed by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by clicking the button Update to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the illumin@@ ator of &amp; digi@@ came ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size is not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright color in the picture . these colours are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it means that the images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; comp@@ ress TIFF files to comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic Color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which was photograp@@ hed on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed light , so the parts of your images that are burned in due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed @-@ lights , as it shows the sharp@@ ness in various rose tones . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the sky@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; and d@@ cra@@ b therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much paint or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the picture options of the digi@@ tization ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the icing in small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ ro@@ h@@ data , which have many cameras and the matrix @-@ colored pixel is available . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ ming construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w will provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ es @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color change correction since you are done during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information like the color information from a colour space in the other to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
questions when an image is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c in which you all save your profiles . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles , you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; leave for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot;
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profiles should be compatible with the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color tone mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given again from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of having to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile with them is intended for . unfortunately not for the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ tization ; many modules support that are written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under &quot; &quot; Quick commands &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the di@@ asch@@ au settings should be easy to understand . the upper controls adjust the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left hand side . on the right @-@ hand side , a button is automatic detection , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place them in the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; check if &amp; digi@@ p@@ ected ; the camera automatically recognizes . if not , you can manually set camera model and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera &apos;s camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window menu . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ came ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tised , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will have to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; when starting , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; &quot;
&quot; looking for new photos to look for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the startup time of &amp; digi@@ came ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; you want to delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the tool@@ bar from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or selecting the &quot; &quot; View / Edit &quot; &quot; context menu . &quot;
&quot; some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file storage or the save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should be able to create a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file storage as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button or button The Rec@@ over of the Rec@@ order Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saving . &quot;
almost every action of the image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing the undo by selecting res@@ ale from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to the undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer than the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a contex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image height , image or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter in the picture and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the picture in full @-@ screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , the tool@@ bar will also be displayed . if you do not wish , you can view this in the Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . complete image templates can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Expor@@ ter . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same tab makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
&quot; the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters are inver@@ ted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; once you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the comment section shows a valuation diagram of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and coll@@ ations . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the valuation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the schema in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a key@@ word to filter the keywords , the key@@ word tree , and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; digi@@ - session . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ word and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all displayed keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to give you key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . a dialog that you will ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper case , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograp@@ hed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner , and the colors you print or publish in the web that matches your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic is based on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflow . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your picture workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for all , why should you use another color space and worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB displays the circle . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; functions Norm@@ alizing , comparing , automatic matching and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ osity values over the entire image , so the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; the same number of pixels makes the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ us@@ ing of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited as working over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can do the white balance in the shell mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. J@@ och@@ ym by P@@ aw@@ el T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are also set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposed indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons &quot; &quot; Save as and Load &quot; &quot; are doing exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it in a text file and re@@ charge it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of rough images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color tone mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors ton@@ al correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to also save your settings so you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; mold effects include four color effects , a solar ization effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ter filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , it was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that arose when using a partially developed pressure from the additional light . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase , finally , creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar ization effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you are applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse issue : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool for ton@@ ing correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the scope of the slider . concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn is to move the controls and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear history is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color p@@ encils can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values can be used to select manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to interact with the output values as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Transi@@ tional Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to see over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a c@@ ached panel to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and the corresponding pixels are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you generated can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the Transi@@ tional Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result shown . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change color sh@@ ading of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you are using the color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color increases to a visible noise that occurs from the color space . color space consists of small noise arti@@ facts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
&quot; the file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format , so you can save it later and then load . &quot;
&quot; the Transi@@ tional Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to see over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is checked . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange @-@ filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
&quot; rot@@ Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar @-@ light @-@ scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rot@@ Fil@@ ters . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ comes ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop type portrait from enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ ture@@ effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; tool frame can add a decorative framework to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative framework . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your picture . the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ aces it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . &quot;
&quot; each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; tool template can apply a template over a picture .
the File menu template can be used in image editing can be used to put templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template ; just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tised @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder to the base folder in the dialog . here , select the folder you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the template tool@@ bar . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focused is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to be combined with minimal differences to a color point . this in turn causes sharp edges a little bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper , as normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; with JPEG images , a camera has often been used internal sharp@@ ening . however , pictures in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners are already using a sharp@@ ening filter during reading the image . if you turn off this , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool . you can use the menu item Con@@ duc@@ ting Follow Focus . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ening increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen one image will re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focused , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment some with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
bl@@ ur@@ ning the filter is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius represents a number of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image one that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ening and hence the beauty error in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected Ent@@ f@@ ission @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Filter@@ ing . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of a bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular spl@@ itting works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular spl@@ itting . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should result in good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , you should use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ ry masks produce better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ ning mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ es the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool &apos;s error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image . &quot;
&quot; directional dependen@@ cy alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a little value smooth@@ s smooth in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD noise , a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm will go through . normally enough here 1 or 2 .
&quot; angular step @-@ step da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles have a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integral part width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is only low . it dou@@ bles the running time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
&quot; the buttons &quot; &quot; Save as and Load &quot; &quot; do this . correction of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact that was caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ windows details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing to the front to determine indicator changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or rou@@ gh@@ er tips may occur . put it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the tolerance tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically m@@ apped more strongly . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance density . if it is elevated , the edges seem smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove rou@@ gh@@ ness and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ular@@ ity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the texture of texture is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting is meant to correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons &quot; &quot; Save As &quot; &quot; and loading make it exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ au@@ ration can be saved in a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera was recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ular@@ ity on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were used to reduce an old colour photo that was read by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which were caused by the scan lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the Hot@@ pixel tool allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
&quot; upload this file to the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels , which are highlighted in the image preview . &quot;
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the proper dark image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark@@ er will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard notices the last dark image and automatically re@@ charges it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image can be seen below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle objective , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often light the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many Center Fil@@ ters need one factor 1.5 or 2 with the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ even effects arise due to movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s felt and color gra@@ y@@ and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a gra@@ dient filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation on a rough photograph taken without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction addresses the transformation with a center filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter , and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which adjust@@ s an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ ment , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the target image ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but fl@@ atten@@ ed at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ des . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth grade . this value appears more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &quot; &quot; rect@@ angle &quot; &quot; has the reverse character of the parameter . &quot;
&quot; zoom : this value is scal@@ ates the image size , resulting in a correction of the first gra@@ des . negative values increase while positive image decreases . &quot;
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start . &quot;
the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cuts or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re@@ use a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction the effect would be apparently the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move it to an important place , like the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ - / cushion @-@ shaped distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transformers cutting out of image processing or via the zoom controls of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs like images from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters setting film gran@@ ular@@ ity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the optional Ad@@ dition film gran@@ ular@@ ity if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gran@@ ular@@ ity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows become white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; because the filter channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; filter film gran@@ ular@@ ity is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ular@@ ity on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back to the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance of daily life . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ iny view specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect on a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that used the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thick@@ ener brushes are better for large images . fl@@ atten the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; drawing coal drawing uses ink and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal @-@ teles@@ cope . the lines , which define the outline in the drawing , are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two regulator with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjusting the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ comes ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ ting effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is looked by glass blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur@@ red effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al imp@@ ure : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by turning the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ry : wi@@ pe the picture through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ red of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking a photographic camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ egr@@ är@@ fe : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift of the pixels , and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ red of an invol@@ un@@ tary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ ur@@ red them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . since dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirrors or turning . the tools for this can be found in the menu Transformers rotation or Transformers . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ former size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was infl@@ ated by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size Tab and listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons are stored as a text file , saved as text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; blowing photo is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to use the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ out , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool To cut down aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; cutting the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of co@@ efficient help allow you to add help , so that you can put your images together better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party organ , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden middle provides more liquid auxiliary lines if you put a picture together . these aids are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ hand rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to produce the golden spiral . it should be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a simultaneous tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be made a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve in a different way . &quot;
horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences knob you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown to the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function Transformers cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get irre@@ plac@@ eable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; switch your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes generated twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ading , the image has nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , are compiled from your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependen@@ cy of other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file extension will be shown . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ came ; in the configuration section , you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ came ; in the configuration section , you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ came ; &quot;
&quot; the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ tised , below . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; understands these formats and will not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies .

many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ came ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft signs , noise suppression , re@@ focused , bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture User quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the preview area to change . these modes are : &quot;
&quot; ver@@ tically , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area . &quot;
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper area shows the original and the lower to the comparison the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview pane , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on to show over@@ flow and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag the frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the picture from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot custom color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folders to search files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown as a line in the p@@ allet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the p@@ allet view , and the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode is selected , you can select this mode by selecting the crossing box under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end sign , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; graph new calcul@@ ates and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and one h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the open graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen@@ shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains opened files . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will also proceed . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , open &amp; eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; during the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that are on one side will be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the Renew@@ t Download page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been altered on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behaviour ( re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
opening the page opens the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the page session management gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm generates a spr@@ ing@@ back model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ g@@ utter for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyc@@ lic structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should print the graph file as parameters , and print the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give the graph file special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it needs the following packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the main tool@@ bar , the status bar , the .@@ colour palette and the grid , where you sign the icon . &quot;
&quot; when the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon should be created by a template or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you do not have any move , this function is disabled . &quot;

&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pixel insert or display Lin@@ e@@ ale and insert one color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as transparent display . you can also set the size : the kar@@ os to small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he own to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the scanning button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the scanning button , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to specify the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files are created . you also have to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the File &gt; Screen shot menu ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work area to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you select the complete working area , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ space , you should choose this delay high enough to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send images to people who are an important one . you can show your favorite photos of the world and show photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so , it is practically your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful application , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply connect the browser window and return to the program . once you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add images should be pressed once you have set any other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , upload the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the picture as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lia options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed prior to up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your collection of images to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitud@@ inal and long@@ itude levels are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the top to see dialog appears then . in order to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file of course contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have track data from one place , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and Differ@@ ence in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set using this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog opens the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to facilitate the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the selection allows to select all albums to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab shows the general look and layout for each page . this tab is self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture a page creates a gallery in which each picture is also displayed . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will appear directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . therefore , you can read the programs to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started in the end to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information occurs . this can be found in PNG format as well . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Cli@@ cker is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy to the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images you want to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , however , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the m@@ peg file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your needs , you can start a coffee with the coding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages above the Settings button below . &quot;
the print wiz@@ ard allows to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats , JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original note from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w that there will be the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RAW file to be converted and run the module . the raw image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches have no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your images frequently or later continue using it , you should not select the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the output button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and tim@@ est@@ amps of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal res@@ izing in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the missing images before . more images can be drawn on the list of images that are to be sent and put down there .
&quot; once you have started the module , the images window with the images you have chosen will be displayed . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and put it there to add you to the list of images that are to be sent .
&quot; with the button images , the selected images are removed from the list of images that are to be sent . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected all the images , you can click OK to open the new message window of your email client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are already attached as attachments . &quot;
most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images you need . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages , looking for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the closing button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant video transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then cancel manually with Es@@ c ; cancel .
&quot; the pictures random@@ ly select that the pictures are displayed in random order , so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album . &quot;
&quot; the best distance , however , depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show the presentation to your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitions between which you can select . random@@ ly choose another effect between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date adjust@@ s currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module imple@@ ments the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , you are now present in each group , thus in persons , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; with this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of their name . you can store your own thumb@@ nail with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the names , select the button , which is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can see symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; to do this , you will have to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the categories editor in the context menu . now you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search entry in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog lets you look at the picture once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , e.g. in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick @-@ entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this Lei@@ ste shows you date @-@ statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries Pre@@ view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview button ) and furthermore , the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create over the menu file HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described in more detail . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created , which is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer even without description . for example , all images are from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not download any pictures that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specify . so , it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , and if he wants to get a larger image , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically supplemented by the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible for viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the configuration options described above have all three based on root folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting pictures is described , which you can export from the File menu ... &quot;
the main feature of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; to copy the file to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album from Autom@@ atically to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu , select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard for import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported into the categories of your present database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will see the various steps of ( 1 ) List of information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml , for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the left window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you will find a list of the categories and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . for more information , please visit the website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; because the modules can be shared by multiple applications among each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little have been tested . therefore , you should always try new modules with the Demo Database using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their images in albums . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , therefore all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category persons , you will be able to do so , so whether you would have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , see the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the image , etc . you can either set any image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you wish , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you type information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped , you can , by making the names moved up , find people faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with notes . in this case click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item of multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ board . in order to show you that it is a sub @-@ group , a special icon will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the note dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort this entry into a sub @-@ category . please note that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and post@@ p@@ one the keys that form the upper edge of the frame , and you can also make your own window by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers among others the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button Options ... and then click on the window to view it . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; in the preview preview , you can also delete pictures . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu . now , the window will be shown that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you may have saved the pictures somewhere , so that you can record the pictures somewhere , that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut is not saved on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy and copy files from folders . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end of those that you want to make for others , click on Current View . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see , control and unlock the menu entry Every@@ thing except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have defined what images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so that all images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for blocking the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; for one , all images on the hard drive and the other can access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file , read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to prevent the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason for you to use all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . this can be previ@@ ew@@ ed from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you load multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . as often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the Plus button can be zo@@ omed again in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation button , the zoom puts the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work in videos , that enter and zoom in with Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste . &quot;
&quot; with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images , you can find it that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the picture and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this case , you can see a picture where features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have put features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have chosen , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right now . &quot;
&quot; categories and features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to finish the painting , select on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects , then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed features , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then , you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or merge the changes . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as a default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the superior object , or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different order , you can set it arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store multiple windows and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below an existing view , drag the starter to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to assign multiple views to one another , simply drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking the map from the top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , pull the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left upward in the bev@@ elling board . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the bev@@ elling board . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location . &quot;
&quot; you can save the current window view with view window code ... Save . a dialog appears , where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be correctly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode equ@@ als the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar , or choose R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognise the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the picture cut to return to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user &apos;s manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è design or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always split up and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur@@ sion stit@@ ch depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged extra points , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually followed and further sub@@ divided . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch off j@@ itter , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , which comp@@ utes diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion . it takes very long to let a scene comp@@ ute with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent , if the related rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opening a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialogue window . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timet@@ able data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to insert the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the level of detail for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projection . this property gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the bottom , a floor underneath the object is rendered . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick s@@ edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more precisely to the parameters you will find in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangements section explains how to create and save window orders .
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be set with the add button , and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove . &quot;
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created using the add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map sheet view together with the previous view and flo@@ at@@ ingly anch@@ ored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should keep in mind the following warnings , before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed anything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you generate . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the App@@ ly button or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( inser@@ ting End@@ ress Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , if at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you only see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose first sub @-@ object . the pig@@ ment will then be shown in the property tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ment preview shows only a matt black material because you still need to type settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , click App@@ ly on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ame your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color you expect . here are further settings required . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select the color each time and change the colors in the view of the properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should be easy to execute , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press En@@ ter or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball would float above the floor as you shifted the floor to one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as on the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first select the object and change the name for example in the Pig@@ ment . click &quot; &quot; Pig@@ ment &quot; &quot; and select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some Finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change values as in the following screen@@ shots , and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the splend@@ or effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected is : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that displays the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the rendering calcul@@ ates how this beam will affect the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , each scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behaviour . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to sne@@ ak rough surfaces without changing any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , by applying a picture file as a color chart . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set , if every image is to be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut keys for the respective window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , charges &amp; cu@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show saves the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show opens ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
this option enables you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
shows great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
&quot; closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed , if no browser window is opened anymore . &quot;
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ cases ; however , you may ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ cases ; . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages , and you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ supply indicator is selected . sk@@ ill@@ ful should indicate the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also view them in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; channels ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes it easier to scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; channels ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes images scan and save images . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog for saving or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format , and the user can also display the images in front of the store . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a default scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; inea ; with the command chan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no default scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel , and quit . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview , and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and a lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialog box is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; channels ; images to select . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each image sc@@ anned image . if &amp; channels ; they automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save file without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre @-@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the Ch@@ ange@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog box for &amp; channels ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; channels .

below you can set up a list of short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set up glob@@ als short@@ cuts .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . thereby you make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not work . &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; to do this , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use of it . &quot;
&quot; configure Feed the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is all@@ uded . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b , with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Menu Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry can be identified . in order to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ending , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archive ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tive amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages . &quot;
&quot; the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org , and attach the link to the Wik@@ i Scrip@@ ts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you only search for a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have difficulty when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; like most applications , it has some options to enable or disable the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details on this can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; in addition to the player window , the player window will turn off the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is disabled , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot;
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; add mood files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save the playlist at the end , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the play@@ lists visible , the play@@ lists appear to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is plug@@ ged .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance , you can adjust the appearance &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray highlighted section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will continue automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last end . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen Display Pan@@ e allows you to switch on O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment will appear the O@@ SD . &quot;
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card .
the collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse Sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the inter@@ viewed and their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected is another set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : the machine is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ fm direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm @-@ server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece when needed .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
send playing pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
&quot; similar performers call : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; you don &apos;t have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib @-@ developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file causing the crash . after that you can delete the file and re @-@ create the collection again .
this is mostly due to Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib @-@ developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , turn off autom@@ . turn off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens to a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be done with ld@@ d &apos;@@ whi@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;s _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help other users or developers . they can also use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ zilla is not suitable for searching for help . please insert only one error , if you have something to repair an error in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do music play there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window has been converted into the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the assessment by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column review . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop them there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add button , you can save the playlist playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you lack the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config utility . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , this really is ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is supporting G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 @-@ decoder are provided in default ( for patent legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you to search for the problem , and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to give another S@@ ink ( for example , oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people , if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , enco@@ des it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also deco@@ ders the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less suscep@@ ti@@ bility react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the registry database from G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the registry database again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . moreover , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm be done with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music that you stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do this , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the En@@ ter to search in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what is now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; to normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the Play@@ lists window . there you can select the rating of a piece as well , by right @-@ clicking on the piece and edit : select comment or pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in dialogue Metad@@ ata . &quot;
the developers do not want to tell you when you &apos;re supposed to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that will not be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bar ... and make the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( top ) and choose Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not comp@@ iling these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configuration and install .
&quot; now I have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you must now install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you will need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok again . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
&quot; set up Amar@@ ok settings ... audio output gives you the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the m@@ ite on the sound@@ card . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . of course you can take this issue yourself into the hand ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed advisor for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have setup &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag your mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can instantly save the remaining entries . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save it using the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add this to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Audio @-@ CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have several options to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed , which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a pack@@ et management system ( e.g. rpm or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers that can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a text display showing the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also selected , while the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q knob is used to set up an equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you check the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player . but don &apos;t let off the full@@ ness of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser provides various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window has been dropped off . the information presented here is now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . among them you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon , you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation . &quot;

&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can perfectly customize and combine the group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you own something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the view of the tree . please refer to the playlist section of this manual in the section to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; below the search filter is a selection box , with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose your total collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . in addition , you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;

&quot; set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue , so you will be played next . &quot;
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - add the pieces in the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details see the section about the Media Player browser .
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn on CD - so the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as a record or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; as a compilation , mark the selected album as a compilation , and thus it appears among different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; recording marker - Change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown among different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click &quot; &quot; Add Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to Open the Di@@ alogue to Cre@@ ate a New Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok is started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Performer sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list of performers . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / music@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there to the music@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z file . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ ending of files can be quite difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries into the desired position . once you type letters , only the pieces will be displayed that contain the letters . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you type in spaces separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , insert a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variants with each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then clicking the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the add @-@ on button , which allows you to add the playlist pieces . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow back and restore . thus , you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback wheels and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the overall play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status of random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed . the status of random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by clicking the mouse double in the corresponding display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ in . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; choose .
behind this entry a sub @-@ menu is hidden with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions covers management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your great move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist , then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist , or use the context menu in the playlist . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details for setting up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ fm profile to work with this dynamic playlist .
&quot; in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of random@@ ly mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist received will be added at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the latest playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;

&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog box is displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file .
&quot; when a project changes and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then cancel between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project , what should happen with it as if you were called for any project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what will happen to you as if you have called the closing file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select the appearing dialog files for addition to the project . this has the same effect as if you want to enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different settings , most of them are described above the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders available on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . &quot;
&quot; open the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should also have the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also cl@@ one if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning in place of the normal copying . the converting / re@@ cl@@ ining a DVD with the help of the copying di@@ alogs is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window appears typically after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , enco@@ ding settings , and even options to modify the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the set medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is ti@@ cked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ bar is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes further down . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs can be set . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is for person@@ alising and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so it is more important for your taste and type of task that will give you preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then give something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ ri@@ ghted , format DVD and other features to generate new projects . &quot;
( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can be easily recorded audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders who are enco@@ ding these WAV files ( compression ) . further enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter &quot; &quot; Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver &quot; &quot; gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use of reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually captured . &quot;
this is just a short list of the main window commands .
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data starts according to the set @-@ up of request in the CD@@ DB register . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ der settings in the setup catalogue - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with another enco@@ der can be read as the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read @-@ in file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) , you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important as both co@@ di@@ tors generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high tone quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better stereo stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the CD , title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title Parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator need to be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where individuals can read the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine . it is to be noted that here only of text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the translator : with that the author is meant ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this way the configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the program@@ mer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use by fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries are for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution , before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ver . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ver is available in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read genuine on it and whether c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , because it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it by quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something which probably only once is done and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them at any time of reading a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the Map General settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be as left / input as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information please ask , so that you will be informed if data on the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed easily with the database entry and the directory name / file name , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , if you want to use the database before , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want a &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number at the same time : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom Fol@@ der for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be given the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ c@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the remainder as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to enco@@ ding more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; that is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots are slightly different from the data collected for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , look for the FAQ section and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; ) , a window will appear , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but pick the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - enter the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot , enter the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the commentary range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . check the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece is in any case and other information you desire . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected so are read out . a simple click on the line turns off the selection of the piece , or press the button All the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the selection button to start reading the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens . &quot;
&quot; click the App@@ ly tab on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of 1 piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus reading and enco@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you know with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; one part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs when it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , may it do . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke play from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time @-@ raising of lyrics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can move to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; sitting support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid starts with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows fall . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played down . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed . in order to get back the original speed , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space key has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the Pause button or selecting the menu item Pause in the tune , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events to be presented and even better : the type of event will be determined automatically to select a song so that you do not have to set anything manually . however , if you select the entry Auto selection in the Settings menu , you will automatically change the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to set up an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section , you &apos;ll see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to set up a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find them in the Collection menu under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original ones .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection will not be saved . consider this if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the add @-@ on button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series according to the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ arranged . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the next song &apos; Next Song &apos; , the entry next song from the menu or press the right arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; in order to skip a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry of Previous piece from the menu or press the button dart left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general MIDI @-@ events transl@@ ates into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and therefore always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE are ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM units and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from your hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary translations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as many times as you wish . however , it is necessary that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; Another Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
&quot; in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the word &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; is meant to be a different percus@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound is always the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percus@@ sions channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it easy in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the percus@@ sions patch on the percus@@ sions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender @-@ event with the value n , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , try to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see what sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; so ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Windows . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . in order to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go on ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; switch windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI @-@ files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I am studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment , I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; yes , I am trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a Mi@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , because I may already have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get money for it . I would like to stress that I can only be more program@@ mer because / if I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - fixing the bug that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a fault notification or just a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems arise , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the Page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you do an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that when &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the processing mode or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected , without equal to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modification of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ let / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
&quot; another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here , the output of m@@ player is visible . &quot;
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ game err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Flash &quot; &quot; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; to enable the &amp; KM@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in the Con@@ figuration dialog file assignment of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , Con@@ sole , or Con@@ sole from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , this must be done by changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the device must be used and the TV channels need to be used , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be supported for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally we use different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ n@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , op@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
there are hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be done as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; k@@ ile ; requires .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the K@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if expan@@ sions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphic interface and within this one simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management need to be called . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn more about it , the manual for Kate should be drawn . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start . &quot;

&quot; to be able to control correctly , good books should be used for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ r ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document .
&quot; document classes : this is what the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ apper &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
enco@@ ding : the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t need to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; with automatic execution of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; an empty line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line for schedul@@ ing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings , ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document sub@@ division into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex file . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the port search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and once to an element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of it . as soon as click on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding point is spec@@ kled in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; master Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ action : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is stored on &quot; &quot; n@@ der@@ ungen &quot; &quot; and it is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for rapid inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The market@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box Fur@@ ther information is available for items such as keywords , joint marks or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created . &quot;
cover : will be used for reference to a specified designation ( choose a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ bli@@ ert is used for determining the font size . it can be specified the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and laying the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets under the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if font sizes are not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the quick @-@ build button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
&quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for the errors . when using quick @-@ action , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the writer e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . &quot;
the changes are cleared only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , li@@ ft@@ work , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ic@@ ure and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background is presented to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wiz@@ ard entered a bit of text , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be executed . to do this , a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and spy . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( engl . d e V ice I n@@ ape ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex , for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed with a print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the transformation in deleted other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview search enables the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this only Modern under settings K@@ ile must be set up ... tools construction is selected .
&quot; in order to scan the pre @-@ select search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on preview search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; file the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; file must be fixed and jump to the corresponding line . to do this must &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( set Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if using quick @-@ action of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not open , an error may be available . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file def@@ aults the error source in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can then be used predic@@ tive La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors for explo@@ sions . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the pre @-@ set items are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re @-@ written or used by the wiz@@ ard for the quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated input of commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps have to be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and executed under the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to find out more about it , the manual for Kate should be drawn . users from &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly with reading the chapter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called from the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip \ \ par .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can add additional jump marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ Intro@@ duc@@ er Edit Br@@ ands , or the relevant key@@ boards will also highlight the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this jump stamp is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
select the word from the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also supports &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back layer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; for the part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key root C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description of the select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit surroundings for an even easier work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command for the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command for schedul@@ ing the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted environmental commands , quickly the outer perspective can be lost . this command bu@@ ys the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not atom@@ ized . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded brackets .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded brackets of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jump@@ ed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted welded groups @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps it can quickly be lost in view above . this command includes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple instructions are used as a guest editor . for the useful implementation it is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple instructions is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and for two complete instructions for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double fixing signs can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when pressing Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it &apos;s not only a new@@ line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments .
&quot; some users want to assign the columns in tables environments , and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the above line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes work . all these modes can be set up for different work modes under settings K@@ ile ... &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and fully gr@@ aci@@ fied by the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by typ@@ ing another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jump stamps can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible via Edit Br@@ ung@@ marken N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ute jump stamp and can then be captured . &quot;
&quot; settings K@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; all settings can be made to these lists . it can be used for different settings lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as aries of general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the inv@@ ocation mode is used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completing the environment . &quot;
&quot; when calling the default mode over the Men@@ Ã ¼ t@@ Edi@@ ting environment or the key / key Alt + Shift key , the command will be continued automatically and it will appear \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the key button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once and K@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
&quot; settings K@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; all settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the reset list of the complete mode for &amp; tex , - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile is used ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word will be replaced by the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l + Alt id@@ key , the character L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; big W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ pers are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many bugs in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; K@@ ile ; the complete fulfil@@ ment for all already written widths . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; menu ... K@@ ile will be scre@@ ened . here , the threshold value for the ad can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the default files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Pers@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche Home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the graphics are designed to capture graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools , and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed group@@ wise in the creation of comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation can be used the keyboard root Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be added to the Men@@ Ã ¼ Project New Project .... Here are the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet fully developed , and can still be used in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . there is a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; is delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application includes tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or stro@@ kes . only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be installed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems .
&quot; many thanks to those who are striving for the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project strive and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&amp; k@@ ish ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for e @-@ mails . the sign@@ atures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface you create random sign@@ atures or day sign@@ atures from a list . this command line interface provides sign@@ atures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; random signature is a signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sign@@ atures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sign@@ atures , the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day you use different sign@@ atures , as with random signature creation you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty sign@@ atures ; in the bottom of the signature . signature Con@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org http : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save , or click on the flo@@ ppy symbol . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sign@@ atures as you want . then , you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removed in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog short command . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the user button below , and enter the new shor@@ tw@@ ave by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for use of &amp; k@@ ish ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all the call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry , the lower the frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking a call list in the shown list , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot;

&quot; to stop the procedure , press the W button or select step @-@ by @-@ step trigger in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to track a system ID in the current &amp; XML catalogue , select System@@ ID ... in the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; to post a Pub@@ lic@@ ID , select Pub@@ lic@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the search value in the then displayed dialog . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; -@@ source files associated with the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking a source entry in the shown list displ@@ aces the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
&quot; all found templates are listed here . it is important to note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T are valid , so several templates can be provided with the same matches and mode details . &quot;
clicking on a template entry in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
&quot; local and global variables are shown on a map card in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code , where a global and a local variable is declared . &quot;
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; contains , then a new XP@@ ath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ position@@ as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece and we give it a graphical interface ! no longer need a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked and finished the icon for the XML processor !
&quot; this application is waiting for a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the popular working folder , let the current job folder be attached . if not , then remove the current working folder and enter the desired folder in the other folder field . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful it is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to output on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked , it is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , delete the current file . if not , delete the check@@ box in the current file and select the file to be re@@ proved using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Review selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; , specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . for both the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; Schema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG validation is required in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file simply . if not , remove the file from the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly a little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all the included plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location it uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to find the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and the S@@ etze button is pressed . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project occurs . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will add a file to the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ sees can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see if such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to be entered is simple . it can be either chosen by the comment text from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word can be entered in a commentary box followed by note text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where the nickname of the name of the team member is , role in the project in the following ways : team Leader Sub@@ project leaders should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project leaders , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over several pages that are dealt with one another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car complete can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added tags . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means , tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close the optional tags : if attached , becomes available for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; start and end tag automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ eti@@ Typ@@ es for the detection of different types of files .
&quot; default character enco@@ ding : enco@@ ding of newly created or other files opened with file opening ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ignored ) , but this setting is removed from the same in the project features if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting here is cut by the same in the project features if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a card ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface changes through changes of M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / dependen@@ cies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning messages area serves the tax of the possibility to switch warning of warnings by hooks from no more questions .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural baum settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing , and how deep in a change of the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such where no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means there may be a valid group for PHP where the if@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load Only @-@ Read Only mode : check if the plugin is denied loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . pick the entry also if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubles@@ hooting has been completely re@@ designed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case it must not be taken care of . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; initi@@ ates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start the execution of the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the current executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; assign@@ s the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without noti@@ fying information on monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script .
&quot; shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not the current ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help you become better .
&quot; document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for brand and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;

&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties di@@ alog@@ ist that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a typ@@ ist .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an ordinary attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
&quot; speci@@ fies the source texts used for filling in the tag editing dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the data source .
&quot; the arguments , which are passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( for example one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the tag . this element is a single element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start using a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; blan@@ ks do not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file one &amp; PHP will be described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as pretty simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with Settings . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the button symbol assigned to this action . by clicking the User button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut is removable . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection box input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written on the standard output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Ac@@ tions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day has attributes and you plan to use its use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; dialog if available to allow an input when using the action . &quot;
this is a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; and ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edi@@ ting Size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will insert ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still which ones , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar and select dialog on the tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the parti@@ tions support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the Con@@ quer@@ or , -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( if a file is opened by the appropriate type ) . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . let &apos;s leave the first part to you , the second we handle here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ figuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ List = func@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index@@ .html &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of chess ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
&quot; blan@@ ks do not affect anything , but keep up &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resources files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for designing the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the contex@@ tual list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now , you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else . in various places there is a menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files can be automatically converted into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ prompt : the string containing in ! Doc@@ type Tag such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little us@@ efulness . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it &apos;s all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; saved . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only this user can use it personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all items are taken in the project tree of the project , which means the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building master , the card managers with information and the tool@@ bars . please propose and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab@@ s with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , like closing the current , other or all card tra@@ ys , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as the basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags located under the mouse poin@@ ter , help the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file if the string is called a file under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste it into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the design views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the representation with card holders are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be performed using the then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can see the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ ly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this type of card displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D used in the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D will be displayed . &quot;
this card tra@@ der shows all the errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed are all error messages ( as there is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the cho@@ col@@ ates of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as a compressed ZIP archive on &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email you can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H ahead of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us would be ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need for their needs . &quot;
&quot; thanks to self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars automation is almost every task possible . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ Center help : / Qu@@ anta Run ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ friction , so that it is correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ friction that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to paste &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
&quot; activ@@ ates the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &quot; &quot; Shift &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script displays error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
off and off of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next , depending on the location of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details . &quot;
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project @-@ Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opening a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or anyone else made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if it is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting through tool@@ bar if this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu items mentioned above . click on . click an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ bi@@ ds schem@@ as depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
veri@@ fies the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant change@@ over between different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries it can sometimes need time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . it is recommended to use map @-@ map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of a entry , the corresponding sub@@ window is activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog influence any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; judge the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , one finds details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add which and the sequences can change . &quot;
&quot; this should generate an aid according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be completed from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when typ@@ ing name , file is automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static content that you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; when a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection of them . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed with the Shift ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders ) can be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to the above , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows the required de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only Gub@@ in is supported . more information about Gub@@ in can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in this way , de@@ bug@@ ging is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Event Con@@ figuration &quot; &quot; window , you can disable event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . &quot;
to open another project you select project to open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ y as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button , call@@ able context menu : &quot;
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password saved on the disk option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be a lot of views in one project , i.e. , by simply sli@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool@@ bar menu or the project tool@@ bar , can be accessed , opened or deleted using the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best accessed via the tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where you can see which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action lab@@ eled , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bar ... and set Settings action .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions introduced at the beginning of each presentation prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ store area under global templates . more information on the template tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ store area under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted in documents based on a template , but the same text area again and again in documents . you can find everything from a comment over a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ based . see for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure as you wish ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File as template as a local template ... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) , the template does not appear in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the thumb@@ nail templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to one template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and dropping or inser@@ ting via the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and create site templates to create a name for the template and backup . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can input head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , paste files or link with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; additionally , you have a context menu ( showing right mouse button ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor available through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ um of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is active , the push @-@ button moves the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , where the position is retained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization interval between the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time span can be set . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip@@ set for fast hosts and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties -@@ Dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the enco@@ ding of the manual , so you can change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just like the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS styl@@ istic template by pressing the file open button and sel@@ ects the file .
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible like in a word processor , by reference to arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing and deleted using button or removal button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it &apos;s important to note that past@@ ing tags are not removed before already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other anchor tag . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the list wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars need to be used .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; are already present . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned post@@ points can be set in a particular file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded styl@@ istic template file name with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . if loaded , for example , a styl@@ istic pre@@ disposition file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a file name , my@@ QNA@@ ME or a given mode of mode is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any my@@ QNA@@ ME that contains the template string . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; is added to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file , and the result was numerous conflicts during the merger . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when running : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder co @-@ operation :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and di@@ stru@@ cts the possibilities of today color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white notes and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
folder 1 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Target Fol@@ der
&quot; opening dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . however , if a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field becomes active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify a output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialogue with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t get out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any Info @-@ Line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a distinction is recognized , one sees the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( Merg@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the aggreg@@ ation column from the text is interrupted in places where the source file has no rows . if the line breaks is enabled , the line will be dotted along broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to resolve the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; ready @-@ to @-@ use conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources for ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , side down , finish , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / last un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , all non @-@ automatically resolved conflicts have to be distinguished as a conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection into cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a line @-@ up character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a line feed + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically stored and restored to the next start . ( menu Paramet@@ ers@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in curved writing . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be plot@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , any selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a new@@ line &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a new@@ line display , but then they could be made visible with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then they could be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white notes . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically solve all conflicts in white notes by using the chosen file as source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are handled in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge operation . check for details below documentation for comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set global over the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the selection fields for the coding a short note appears , which is the local enco@@ ding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
disable this to supp@@ ress any changes in white notes in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ant or ignor@@ es C / C + + -@@ comments enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines . simply send the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . you can use this feature for example to cut distr@@ acting parts or to correct the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when using the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . any input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line distance to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression of the text in the first pair of characters . the \ \ 1 converts the text found in upper@@ case letters .

&quot; while experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor for line balance . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ aliz@@ ations at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacing / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ Aller@@ gens are different in per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and mer@@ ging . subsequent operations only change the data that the line interval algorithm looks like .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate the merge and show the simulated changes without performing it
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will find a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files will be listed , which were then compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder that was found during scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by folding down the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file compar@@ isons will be started and a comparison window will appear . &quot;
the icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be automatically chosen . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option Neu@@ ere file instead of merge ( unsure ) is checked , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders may not be started . &quot;
&quot; if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; this includes the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as a target , in the two folder merge B will be chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . in order to merge the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears to indicate the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options through , simul@@ ating and inter@@ rup@@ ting . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue / continue directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , continue his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue to skip the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any other way before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , it notes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not again merge them together . even if the merge operation was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the trust of the change date . no real comparison occurs . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size . for example , this can be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of the merge of files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed too . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another file , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension already exists , it will be deleted without any further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not just the merge entire folder . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge option is visible while assem@@ bling single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch to the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder . as soon as you save the result , the status will be set to yield and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder together . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new entry &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an ft@@ p server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archives with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; if a link to a file or folder shows , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , per@@ missions or change date are removed from the original . ( note the option of trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP will always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , the file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then , start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch file to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ lies ) there are already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not shared the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if similar lines appear next to each other , this story is , but this is more the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict simply by clicking the code and selecting the A / B / C button . this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ated ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the root folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift inser@@ tion ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marking .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the folder with the update after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( behavior is likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the relevant window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed appropriately when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual working surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , finish them or move them . this works both within one desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop as well as on other work@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and Finish . if however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ized , Maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual desktop are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field indicates the number of virtual desktop spaces . if it is shown together with name , the names will be provided with ordin@@ al@@ numbers , eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ Main window can be determined : classi@@ cally allows &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , as from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows @-@ managers appear ; horizontal displays all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation at the side on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with its content . it also runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then choose swit@@ cher to set up dialog ... let the dialogue settings appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have any writing permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign it to a value . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; run , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the cur@@ sor as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can use a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cur@@ sor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift ; push button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store it into a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
start or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to play against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; automatically re@@ charge your inserted short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ lar@@ ging and Re@@ duction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the printing ink in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment . &quot;

&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ es a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and each mouse click aches pain . &quot;
&quot; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ es a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and any mouse click em@@ ulate pain . however , it may require a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you are suffering from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by the use of the mouse , and as with all ergonomic tools : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can execute pulling with pressed mouse button . this way you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this time period must be ri@@ pped after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click away . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ament is switched on , the shooting time is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will wait until it releases the mouse button again , if there is no mouse @-@ mouse @-@ mouse . &quot;
&quot; if this function is enabled , a slow comment will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is checked , &amp; km@@ m@@ et@@ ool ; starting with every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; it is currently only available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values specified when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will reset to the state after the last pressing . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should first be switched off . if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later shift the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
&quot; if your mouse j@@ okes , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the cur@@ sor , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take the mouse over to do so . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily be scr@@ apped with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re using an intelligent shift in this case , it means that &amp; km@@ m@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse click . by doing this , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . however , parking the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it to cli@@ p@@ board and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice about it : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and press the Shift key , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this way , whenever &amp; km@@ m@@ ool is pressed , the mouse button p@@ ushes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart shift begins to use the shift time . later , you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , must be installed . that should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&quot; the program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome , causing pain in the heart of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ m@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can let dum@@ b users talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the course of conversation , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice @-@ over@@ s of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without having to typ@@ ing them . of course , the text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you define the dictionary for the word tran@@ che . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word tran@@ scription . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a sequ@@ ential memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have a mouth ; properly directed , you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can choose sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the site of Wor@@ lds and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with which text is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command will depend on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; this option is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you decide which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ book @-@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of In stock , the chosen passage is spoken directly and additionally added to the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen passage is only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; using the second drop @-@ down button of the editing window for text passages , you can determine if the text pass@@ book @-@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; the book is saved with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book script is not saved . select Before Save , ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the dictionary you currently use . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply obtained by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to handle text pass@@ angers is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays are shown as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either click on the selection in the tool@@ bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ books or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , the selected text will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;

&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is by default placed over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar is displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ t system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java , written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is pleased to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , print text by calcul@@ ator . it is stored in a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can re @-@ issue again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; before you can use it , you must install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise use the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the standard speaker . &quot;
various spokes@@ persons for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several pressure peaks for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; Card@@ board &quot; &quot; speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed . it also automatically appears when you launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below a row further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to map file and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text files . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marker , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears when pre @-@ reading is automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , stop , stop and record text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to preview . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and activate the voice @-@ over@@ s there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that is read pre @-@ read , and select the language issue in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that is read pre @-@ read , and select the language issue in the main menu . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you of events that are prescribed for you . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , to set up a message in which your nickname appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filters are edited text before being sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to select false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the output of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; somebody who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
the rest are simple text orders . each order you hit from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
&quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reading , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
&quot; strings replacing parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be provided with pre @-@ defined string er@@ aser filters such as : - ) by text , or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with microphone selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages over it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter does not cross it it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the following set @-@ up di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the appropriate replacement text . upper and lower case letters are not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replace .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here a language is entered , the filter is only used if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 is shown , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( space ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it in di@@ alogs add or edit , for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card card speaker or to a speaker with specific properties . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is transferred to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program pre@@ tends to the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker set on the card card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it by clicking on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to show the dialog of the speaker . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can give T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;

&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re @-@ format filter , but when using the module for Festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not have this voice to read out of web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the PAT@@ H environment variable . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just ch@@ ewing g@@ ossi@@ p . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option character enco@@ ding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be downloaded from it . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ compression at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .ht@@ m@@ l. &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS works with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be run on the command line in a &amp; console ; &quot;
&quot; the list of languages above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , check the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information which is not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for using another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ compression or download the tar@@ ball up to date , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr shall be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or alternatively , repeat the output or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ person chooses , look in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the board speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card speaker setup will be shown . as an example , the set up of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; in general , Western languages are ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be shown at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the preview . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited set . the speaker ID is the column ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can set up or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text applications are listed and managed . output of screen re@@ stores , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see in . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; place the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als about half and 200 % , about the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this card card , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks volumes . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the conduc@@ tive sound and the conduc@@ tive message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ notification messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to read &amp; k@@ de pre@@ views ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read before . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected Custom text templates , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . default sel@@ ects the speaker , who is shown as the top entry in the list on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , this action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list .
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All notification are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
&quot; you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , because this is the default voice , the festival used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for Speed or Sound in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can &amp; kt@@ ts sub@@ divide text into single sentences . this allows you to skip or pause on the card ticket , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ level recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; in the simplest way , you can learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch on the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; can start faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only be removed . don &apos;t change anything at this filter unless you know what you &apos;re doing . &quot;
text recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ations and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab symbols are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ screen ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter , you can insert it again by loading the file Standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card menu , you can over@@ ride the speaker &apos;s settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
&quot; use the most suitable speaker with all the features of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who is closest to the original set @-@ up characteristics . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
tick this check box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the Def@@ ault button and use the speaker , which is most likely to follow the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a number of order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trac@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is an un@@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or un@@ installing G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with a different application . if I pause , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts at the same time , a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA occur , which prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for potential solutions , please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices add the new voice . as a guide , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; there is a setting speed on the card card audio . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( that &apos;s because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ forming filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t realize that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , Festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate drawing filter filter , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more to proceed or go back . on the cart track orders will be displayed , the order exists only from a set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , call@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , by calling G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with audio output . if your system is also included , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; add a text order and start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can so@@ x install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Debian distribution guidelines ) . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example , &quot;
&quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ compression echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . to do this , you will find the instructions included with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices M@@ SU _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a k@@ yr@@ ill@@ an ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from si@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .
&quot; with this method , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed at the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices . it is necessary either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival from
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the recording of error correc@@ tions is not required , you only have to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; pick and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ pack the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file must lie in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer , currently only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . find Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer working with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phones and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least a German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Page and un@@ zip it to / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA with un@@ zip .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file name . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly .
&quot; ep@@ os is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the board speaker , click Add . select the Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian language and ep@@ os T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the ep@@ os programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the programs on the card board speaker . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you have to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module enables you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting the K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for users :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; Start . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting the network characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers are installed for network hardware and other devices in installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded , if the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting module network settings , it tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the choice of hands is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and ease of release . by marking the setting of non @-@ recur@@ ring questions the definition can be set permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are gray displayed , which means changing is not possible . in system administration mode , click the system administrator mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
&quot; the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the set @-@ up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button interface ... set up in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Extension settings shows the dialog with additional options . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automatic , the TCP / IP settings are obtained from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the option manually , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . a switched @-@ off network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface ... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and click interface ... &quot;
&quot; determines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine is called to http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; you can add , remove or modify this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the new nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server , then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and click the Edit button . edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of named hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list includes some known hosts some entries , which &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... Add the dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the familiar computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Mak@@ ing Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately activated in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found major dis@@ sem@@ ination . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected that it will continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focusing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who is a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that lets you run other programs following a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can see a list of assignments and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on as root , this appears for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and accessed . &quot;
&quot; in case of a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and under description appears disabled . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables appearing here include the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks specified , except power . in a de@@ activated variable , the description will be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , select the Tas@@ ks folder first . then go to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click on the Tas@@ ks folder and then click New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; here you can specify the name of the program to be started . you can either select a relative or an absolute path name . if you are looking for the program first , select select ... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; when you specify both monthly ( e ) and weekday ( s ) , the task will be performed at a suitable date as well as on a suitable weekday . for example , if you choose between 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be run independently of the week on the 1st and 15th of the week , and on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they are falling . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , select the task to be removed first . then go to Edit Cut . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select cli@@ pping , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first one has to be cut into the cli@@ p@@ board or have been copied . only then is inser@@ ting at all available . select the tasks folder . then go to Edit Inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the Tas@@ ks folder and select Insert , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select one . then go to Edit edit menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and change ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. There will then process the dialog task in which you , as described above , can edit the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to delete . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it , and select the state with the menu item Edit . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in its description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task and select En@@ able . confirm that program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to perform a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit New menu . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the variable folder and New ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
send e @-@ mails from the program to another than the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes are only made when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , select the variable to be removed first . then , go to edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy a environment variable , select the variable to be copied first . then , go to Edi@@ ting Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the variable and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert an environment variable , first one has to be cut into the cli@@ p@@ board or have been copied . only then is the option inser@@ ting at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit Inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , select the variable to be working first . then go to Edit Change ... Altern@@ atively , you can click on the variable with the right mouse button , and modify ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then process the dialog variable in which , as described above , you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , select the variable first . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ ac@@ ti@@ ver@@ en an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the menu item Edit activ@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the variable with the right mouse button and select En@@ able . make sure that the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you need to save the cr@@ on@@ tab . select File Save . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only become active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard jack ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose output , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the tim@@ el@@ ines of the user . &quot;
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which was beyond the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife said : how much longer does it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; spin the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; not the pre @-@ spl@@ its on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ split , it searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . now , the band can be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting to be form@@ atted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape , all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Sh@@ ech@@ at menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and choose the menu entry test ....
&quot; once the scan process has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub @-@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . it will only restore the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been rest@@ art@@ ed , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index@@ .html on the basis of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up , which are located on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be assigned separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , it will automatically dis@@ car@@ ve the band automatically . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware block size will change for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you need to tell the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the band was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar files , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited with the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open . will not show you this , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the directory / var / log , for normal users . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteri@@ on or according to entered strings . add a string to the filter bar , so only the log lines will be displayed , so that only a log line will display the entry All . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of step errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the level critic . the color display of minutes lines can be disabled by setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can turn the option to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all the new add @-@ in protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. , you will find further information about the Sour@@ ces Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in Linux &amp; Linux ; it is because it is easier to use , more powerful yet more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d.@@ D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services don &apos;t include such things as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls do not include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have something confused , then you come to repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line , as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will start with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could and eg ; a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n , or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . this will not happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new range . in order to only copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; sometimes the sorting number of an entry cannot be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to add the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore items thrown in the tr@@ ash . be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of the DAT@@ EN@@ VER@@ SION , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then , edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary software programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not a standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( as well as if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like and eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice when their configuration files are not available or set up wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made any changes , you need to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it will appear the dialog for user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only represented if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the password management map appears , if Shadow Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , where the space restrictions in each case are in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space restriction .
&quot; the group of card groups informs about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group , belonging to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s dialog properties contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Ad@@ ding from the user or group , or click the appropriate add button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works in the same way . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default business system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
