<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>

<seg id="239">"TIFF is widely distributed as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (default). however, a problem is that this format was adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types."</seg>
<seg id="240">The Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is perhaps one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blockquot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together."</seg>

<seg id="378">"if the topic is based on colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflow. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result."</seg>

<seg id="389">"functions Normalizing, comparing, automatic matching and contrast extend from the menu Correcting automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminosity values over the entire image, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced."</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same number of pixels makes the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re-jiusing of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to carry the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited as working over a colour space with 8-bit per color. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can do the white balance in the shell mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small Luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are also set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons" "Save as and Load" "are doing exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it in a text file and recharge it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button resets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of rough images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tone mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tonal correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to also save your settings so you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"mold effects include four color effects, a solar ization effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canter filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, it was also called Sabatier, an effect that arose when using a partially developed pressure from the additional light. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase, finally, creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper."</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar ization effect. the original image is the (1), and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse issue: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool for toning correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the scope of the slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn is to move the controls and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be seen. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box, it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear history is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitization; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces particularly in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocused is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to be combined with minimal differences to a color point. this in turn causes sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper, as normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera has often been used internal sharpening. however, pictures in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners are already using a sharpening filter during reading the image. if you turn off this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu item Conducting Follow Focus."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen one image will refocus the tool. under refocused, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment some with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">Blurning the filter is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a number of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image one that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpening and hence the beauty error in faces, skies and water surfaces avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected Entfission-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular splitting works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular splitting. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should result in good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1, and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"in most cases, you should use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cuts, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurry masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurning masking a larger neighbourhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothes the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool's error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove non-desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CIMg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a little value smooths smooth in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD noise, a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm will go through. normally enough here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular step-step da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles have a long runtime. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0.1, 10]: integral part width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is only low. it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons" "Save as and Load" "do this. correction of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact that was caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindows details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing to the front to determine indicator changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or rougher tips may occur. put it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerance tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically mapped more strongly. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance density. if it is elevated, the edges seem smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove roughness and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes, a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu item Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove palate's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>

<seg id="568">"many Center Filters need one factor 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise uneven effects arise due to movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's felt and color grayand film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a gradient filter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough photograph taken without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction addresses the transformation with a center filter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright."</seg>

<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">The ton- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cuts or size changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you reuse a picture and then perform a tonne-shaped correction the effect would be apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move it to an important place, like the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the ton- / cushion-shaped distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transformers cutting out of image processing or via the zoom controls of this dialog."</seg>

<seg id="592">"below the preview, you can set two parameters setting film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the optional Addition film granularity if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows become white like snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"because the filter channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"filter film granularity is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back to the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambiance of daily life. in case you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grainy view specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurred effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial impure: blurred the image by turning the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>

<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformer size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was inflated by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>

<seg id="644">"depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool To cut down aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation."</seg>

<seg id="649">"the settings of coefficient help allow you to add help, so that you can put your images together better. these help are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party organ, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden middle is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides more liquid auxiliary lines if you put a picture together. these aids are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third-hand rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to produce the golden spiral. it should be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a simultaneous triangles. diagonal to these lines can be made a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="659">Horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences knob you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown to the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after turning a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function Transformers cutting out of the image processing."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better stereo stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / used to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the CD, title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title Parameter of & kaudiocreator need to be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where individuals can read the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine. it is to be noted that here only of text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (referring to the translator: with that the author is meant) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in this way the configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use by freedb, the geographical closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see also note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined entries are for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution, before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined codiver. more information about Kodiver is available in the section Welcher Kodiver."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)." lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read genuine on it and whether cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;)."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 key words (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, because it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to it (eg; by trying to copy something into it by queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudioCreator;, something which probably only once is done and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD;, which must be repeated for each read & CD;"</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them at any time of reading a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read it the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>
<seg id="1553">"the Map General settings. here you don't have much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be as left / input as shown in the screenshot."</seg>

<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading of the & CD; connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"the second selection box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename will be changed easily with the database entry and the directory name / file name, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode, if you want to use the database before, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following card card."</seg>

<seg id="1568">"the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flipped to the right to see everything."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"--preset extreme" defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.

<seg id="1575">"since we use a & CD; that is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots are slightly different from the data collected for a & CD. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will point to the differences."</seg>

<seg id="1580">"attention: if the & CD has been successfully fetched by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD;), a window will appear, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; fits."</seg>
<seg id="1582">"if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but pick the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="1587">"attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it contains already the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with uppercase letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and only 28 characters for the commentary range. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags."</seg>

<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender-event with the value n, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, try to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & so; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2202">"as the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;"</seg>

<seg id="2205">"select text in your document and click File As Template Save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with drag and drop to the thumbnail templates."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"the creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to one template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and dropping or inserting via the Conqueror file tree."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"in the file tree or in the project files, you can click a folder on the right and create site templates to create a name for the template and backup. by default, it is stored in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can input headlines and footers or dynamically with & PHP; create, paste files or link with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to specify the behavior of a folder, click the right mouse button on the folder and select properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & Source editor available through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; -editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohandum of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works exactly like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. with pressing F9 this mode is active, the push-button moves the active cursor from a window to the other, where the position is retained in the document."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronization interval between the VPL; -editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically the time span can be set. in principle, the recommendation: a small chipset for fast hosts and a large span for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"the document properties -Dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the encoding of the manual, so you can change the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column. "</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just like the meta elements. editing CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylistic template by pressing the file open button and selects the file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"using the cursor is possible like in a word processor, by reference to arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted through typing and deleted using button or removal button."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"inserting tags is done in the same way as the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it's important to note that pasting tags are not removed before already existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other anchor tag."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time changed the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file, and the result was numerous conflicts during the merger."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many more useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when running:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder co-operation:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and distructs the possibilities of today color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white notes and tabs are displayed visibly. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 1 Folder 1 Folder 1 Folder 1 Folder 2 -o Destination folder kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 Ordner3 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 3 -o Target Folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialog allows you to manually typing filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. however, if a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field becomes active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to specify a output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialogue with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these features are, it would be a relatively large effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't get out of & kdiff3; pull out. only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any Info-Line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a distinction is recognized, one sees the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (Merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for preprocessor and in few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the aggregation column from the text is interrupted in places where the source file has no rows. if the line breaks is enabled, the line will be dotted along broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the Insert button, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / last difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-image downwards) or to the next / last unresolved conflict. therefore, all non-automatically resolved conflicts have to be distinguished as a conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the selection into clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion)."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix versions use a line-up character\, and Win32-based systems use a line feed + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, therefore you should not use binaries."</seg>

<seg id="2335">"automatically solve all conflicts in white notes by using the chosen file as source. (preset is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu."</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge operation. check for details below documentation for comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is attached to the Suffix .original. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>

<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing command."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress any changes in white notes in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignorant or ignores C / C + + -comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines. simply send the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first hand over this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets your needs. you can use this feature for example to cut distracting parts or to correct the recirculation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first be given to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only when using the line. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your needs. any input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line distance to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergulary expression of the text in the first pair of characters. the\\ 1 converts the text found in uppercase letters.</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessor for line balance. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit and each hit will be replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several realizations at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / regexp / replacing / SCHALTER'Allergens are different in perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for the display and merging. subsequent operations only change the data that the line interval algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="2361">"often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders with & kdiff3; complete folders."</seg>

<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of individual files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">"if three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as a destination folder."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)"</seg>
<seg id="2368">"while reading the folder, you will find a small news window about current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files will be listed, which were then compared."</seg>

<seg id="2522">"do not use the intelligent shift if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and press the Shift key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again."</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">"filters are edited text before being sent to the speech-dispatcher program. they are useful for improving the pronunciation, to select false spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to bypass certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"to understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program" speech-dispatcher "works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the requested orders will be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">"messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you & eg; a long text read on a website, you can with & kmouth; somebody who just enters the room. & kde; -Notifications are also news."</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you hit from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four orders are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such pre-reading, this issue is stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"strings replacing parts of a text by other text. the resulting parts can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be provided with pre-defined string eraser filters such as: -) by text, or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way."</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"with microphone selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card card speaker, you can read text from KDE messages over it."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"if a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & ktts; sent, it will be processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited with the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; features available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open. will not show you this, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the directory / var / log, for normal users."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or according to entered strings. add a string to the filter bar, so only the log lines will be displayed, so that only a log line will display the entry All. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of step errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the level critic. the color display of minutes lines can be disabled by setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can turn the option to new lines in the main window's context menu to display all the new add-in protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org., you will find further information about the Sources Sources of & ksystemlog."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in Linux & Linux; it is because it is easier to use, more powerful yet more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.d.Dort, you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services don't include such things as setserial, which only once started. such calls do not include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have something confused, then you come to repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line, as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will start with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could and eg; a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user-level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv;. it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. this will not happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new range. in order to only copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"sometimes the sorting number of an entry cannot be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore items thrown in the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of the DATENVERSION, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then, edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary software programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not a standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (as well as if they are in the correct directory). some services (like and eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice when their configuration files are not available or set up wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
