&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very cl@@ eric love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in comments for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won with the Repub@@ lican elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party nom@@ inees . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I was unable to reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; he did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game .
&quot; m@@ umps of intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or maybe because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful and indicates in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . ) : as much as &quot; c@@ asser@@ tion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game of white in reference to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the Great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the White Americas of this promise and says : &quot; Hell with diversity , freedom of religion , and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now a b@@ umps country , &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ ac@@ a together ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope for hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ tle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , tim@@ ber@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ ac@@ a - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ ac@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before , a violin made out of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from re@@ processed material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people of Cat@@ aly@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law cr@@ us@@ her of this kind at its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior co @-@ worker of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of lo@@ oting of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 initiated by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the Premier out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand for each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is not regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect . thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing were imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also by sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i is also very aware of the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify the ships that fish in forbidden areas . such suspic@@ ious routes can also be discovered , such as those that indicate that a ship will load his caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports , which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen entering into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; among other things , among other things , actions include like sailing under false flag , fake license documents , indication of phant@@ asy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a lack of organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You must not run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to Me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal hole hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious vessels . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has followed and found fle@@ eting vessels . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to make suspic@@ ious ships more precise .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellite . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that links various levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find ag@@ prising ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
yet F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Ocean protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and by which the position of any trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; ships , who used to fish without a license earlier and hardly had any consequences , now know they are being observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile gained a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries revenue , since then fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board , whose use was prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces with the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Security is the aim to further develop more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia had to report its first great triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was traveling under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the cosmos .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are deemed to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the office of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ as government rejected the opposition &apos;s request to a referendum on the matter of office , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into the void , in which they gathered in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate is also run in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which becomes apparent in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by acute lack of food and medicine . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the office of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the refusal of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was held , the referendum was held for many as the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to conclude a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is so far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;
thank you ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ witter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ Gl@@ d@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela , Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ?
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; cri@@ es this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell of con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not bear any skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the turn , which forms the level of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial commission - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado say that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fake .
here is your resurrection !
on the road !
&quot; others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to make critical voices ob@@ struc@@ ted : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or to buy . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was char@@ tered on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; now , in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , Qui@@ j@@ ano said to his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was investigated for crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that this was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was in prison La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen for himself a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everybody called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with an ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina . &quot;
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok .
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ then the prisoners will be tor@@ tured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance of the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were removed and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ aw@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found that they were attached to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was trapped just there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , inj@@ ecting him with water and hun@@ ted him a load of 220 Volt into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... as a dirty v@@ ass .
&quot; years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can harm another so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were ch@@ ained with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay with the face down@@ wards - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people were sitting quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero assembled a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors of the Civil Society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was sentenced to death . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you come here is also the way you came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have been changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ izing a number .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military myself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ onet or maybe military badges that one has fought against an enemy whom you have fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and steal the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not war @-@ yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; You who were driving cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do this !
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar pul@@ lover out of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes back home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a conspir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last shy act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl back home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families with whom they could pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grinding and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought of displaying my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ aches for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me , what all exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then I don &apos;t forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I got the first advertisement .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally told my own father .

&quot; the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court had sentenced to life imprisonment and nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were free sp@@ ells . &quot;
eleven of the initial 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .

&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military officers , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Silent Chamber :

the Court of Human Rights is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for the victims for years .

&quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese City Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , last month witnesses to a very particularly mis@@ erable translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word , which was &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; , &quot; was fal@@ sely , but perhaps also with vi@@ cious h@@ ind thank &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself , from 1st to 20th September . &quot;
&quot; adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was made to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n writes in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the defective English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , which are involved nationwide in accidents , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , was caused in 2005 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors had 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of altogether 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the name @-@ named repor@@ ter , published on Yahoo , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese do seem against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation error has , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So flaw@@ ed the translation is actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not very few such comments .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be . &quot;
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ people with English as their native language , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees , can still produce translations in the company @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling pro@@ positions , which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this applies especially to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but by large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay &apos;s online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet entries of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online channels contributed recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which opposed the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the duties of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this as &quot; &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ Sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a closure of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also affects the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a Internet site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third transmitted channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who was transferred live to the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country is becoming more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ ans who were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ tural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Fall schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes her under @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children will have to pay for countless days of house@@ work which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice designated as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated in the Cri@@ mean tas is generally not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that their daughter is in the belief that they are able to finish their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with him and justi@@ fies his exploitation with faith , gives them a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will only learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ mean , to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if there is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ ti@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street , or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn . &quot;
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they cleaned the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to hunger , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the refrigerator , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing next to him and read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists , such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe the official media reports of the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he kept them intelligent , but did not inter@@ rupt with her . &quot; &quot; the host had found someone to listen while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often permit me to visit my family because they believed that there was &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose their education , which they had made possible to lose . &quot;
but she was completely clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the chic@@ an@@ ists who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas if they go to school . &quot;

society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and p@@ ests in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the Administr@@ ator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please register .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the town Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have an el@@ f@@ ty girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , who would like to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; then , the author of the display switched back once again : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I &apos;m writing again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill writing Egyptian users of social media to sign up with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently approved a bill on &quot; regul@@ ating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is adopted by the Parliament , users and users of social media must register in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of accepting the law , users should register with their correct names and ID numbers on the site to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a cash @-@ bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill consisting of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent cur@@ ses , defines social media as &quot; any application running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video judge and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are to make up the registration . unclear is also how they should account those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the stage of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , deputy and promot@@ er of the bill of law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the Office of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations to get through the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tive research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine it is just as they are forc@@ efully controlling physical public and private spaces that could be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislature &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary deputy Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish environ@@ ment@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published as part of an agreement on content sharing . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ator H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost of the Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) , a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild game is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to passion@@ ately reveal another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region can be established . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the nor@@ theastern Japan @-@ based daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been for@@ ci@@ bly ev@@ acu@@ ated , since the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had a nuclear accident , already that alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local residents .
&quot; the report provides detailed information on Merg@@ ers and Ac@@ quis@@ itions , Equity / Deb@@ t Off@@ er@@ ings , Private Equity , Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period . &quot;
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses were completed ( in the district of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one still tries to reloc@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ ac@@ uation of Beh@@ ind Par@@ ents ( G@@ ov@@ et@@ su ju@@ lie@@ ak@@ u ) to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the 2011 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees resi@@ ding after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent here . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by the disaster , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of marine fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have been affected large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the nuclear lock zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
what about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused on the situation of the Ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ causing , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 level , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation systems , which are still in Beh@@ el under@@ lined hausen , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it appears at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love for music has been associated with the lack of shared language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being sm@@ ashed by the police in nationwide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday he had beaten him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ stock . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread quickly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian State of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active ministry until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls on further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father , because he was sabot@@ aged by the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police over@@ gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which there was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber body@@ shells and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; said Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to abst@@ ain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
once again the Brazilian media sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window .
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo pur@@ pos@@ efully reported about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively depic@@ t their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing . &quot;
you must also recognize this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the villages in Cuba , forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization &quot;
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in whole Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ greg@@ ation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after planting the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its facilities until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ bs his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembered exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 @-@ produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago , but the poor harv@@ ests are no longer new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry shut off ?
the old railway station of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive it became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantation and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated most , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the place is maintained , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents that would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed and the letters came more and more often . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that gener@@ alized the facilities in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted highly through grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disman@@ tle them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with early age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were used to spare parts .
&quot; without prospects , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ one harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a bear@@ able person , but he for@@ gives the lies that he told him . &quot;
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is in pension for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because he is bit@@ terly . &quot;

first Nations @-@ Kids use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it by Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , Work@@ shop@@ pers launched mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by ped@@ ago@@ gue David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will make the young participants discuss topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ activity &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Sur@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences through globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters don &apos;t always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well a translation into English , translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day you will take our scre@@ am .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; this way , they can grow and go forward to our youth . &quot;
this is how they can do what it meant to the Creator .
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the C@@ ree language , Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ able script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; ) outside of typical restaurants in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see sculp@@ tural dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plasma Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) are displayed by any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of small companies that produce those sculp@@ tural dishes that the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic gro@@ unded mobile phone tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refriger@@ ation mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say , &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic rub@@ bers can also assume a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow us on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot; Sche@@ dule &quot; Sche@@ dule &quot; Sche@@ dule &quot; Sche@@ dule &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the criminals and drinks regularly dip into statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , fully pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning to live with drug trade &quot; ) giving these victims a voice and stories of people who were caught in the battle between the enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime is not only a fear of our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret tom@@ bs according to his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not get paid out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the perpetr@@ ators when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they would pol@@ lu@@ te those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by being &quot; &quot; permanent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to persu@@ ade them to be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district : &quot; how a family was pill@@ aged with threats . &quot; in this , she describes how armed criminals dis@@ car@@ ded money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are apart from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by force . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence caused by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the Om@@ bud@@ sman for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ als to an average of 8.5 acres per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country &apos;s soul .
&quot; only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages linked to it include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to elev@@ ate a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something gone up for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , he fell victim to that of the refu@@ elling trol@@ leys . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ op@@ ed including a cinema nearby that was full of people who viewed the World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident form the gru@@ esome scene of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ tered bodies lying on the floor while individuals are watching them .
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been er@@ ased several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a man to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be displayed figur@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , such as this example , mistakenly put the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image origin@@ ates from an aci@@ dic Arab message that fal@@ sely claimed that the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians would have taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the seen picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have defined examples of abuse of abuse and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be fully tigh@@ tened ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed by Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only mention the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n quem@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ an@@ os &quot; &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has contained the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ witter@@ bit@@ es after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
an association of students of theology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims through the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .

an inhabit@@ ant of the Old Town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tr@@ ento posted this message to his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bombar@@ d@@ ments of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar &apos;s government published a judge on what they considered &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed messages and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this adjustment , which was exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech are running and used by extrem@@ ist groups to determine that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein delivered His 2012 , that monks and politicians had been involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the Kath@@ olic close to An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital has expressly declared that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later in circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by an &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) also show Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the craw@@ ler and isolated , they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper issue , however , is what happens if readers cannot believe these images any longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water surrounding a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of for@@ ci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is to acknowledge the tragedy . at times , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that for@@ ci@@ bly images and viewers des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with violent presentations in the news media , it is true that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from the context or completely ab@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; however , every study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
Foto@@ by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
&quot; these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context are required to understand precisely what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ amp@@ unk language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Please note your parents in recognition of how they have tried for you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being heated in the sun on cold days .
in Birds its own words from his blog About :
&quot; they der@@ ive other cultures , revealing other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; uns@@ ur@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite ones here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka embr@@ aces the worst flood disaster of the decade
Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
&quot; due to strong rainf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped on the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud alan@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; the rains left Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water conditions in some areas were slowly returning . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ erk@@ crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water @-@ peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations , and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants of the floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pic@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; key that allowed users to retrieve a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust you my four years old daughter , she trust@@ s me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others gu@@ en@@ code slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has built itself in their imagination . &quot;
they dism@@ iss me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with being Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into , will be horri@@ fied . &quot;
to be dis@@ cour@@ aged
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of him when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as a Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that Western books have been colon@@ izing for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to arrest them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ less sc@@ ars dominate our news feed . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries in the last three decades , while the US was not even able to choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and su@@ cking Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , both of them are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who guide movements for change .
&quot; it is evident that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on African ground by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought to this by slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this nar@@ ration has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ istic attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion are
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has never failed to grasp the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population is African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ aware Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now inevitably Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of picking up my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for pe@@ pp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m jo@@ king , we do not carry all tissue peb@@ bles with us . &quot;
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be chosen for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who r@@ ushes a woman the head@@ scarf . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ liest forms attacks our belonging .

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the br@@ anding see that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter , when I kept her in my arms , and her Arabian verses for shelter , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , eventually pos@@ ing her sisters in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother , mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; as they have decades ago won a competition of the art of the flower arran@@ ger in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see at that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her accomplished and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me , when I had a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , which - over centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire &quot; which established a company called Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ in@@ ese Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Y@@ aan we@@ pt sore for his family in India &apos;s K@@ ash@@ mir family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have colon@@ ized all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first rif@@ le bomb of history was thrown out over a Muslim country over a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons which did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
&quot; to be an American Muslim , it means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy goes home and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that twenty @-@ ten years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this land . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er cube , but is represented in the reduced two &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against them . &quot;
&quot; being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility is made up of Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush , and were wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list , &quot; which mainly refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we conduct and the bombs , which we throw down to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sli@@ ghtest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deeply involved to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are coming back decades to see the roots of our fears , and the wrong and dangerous prints that we are ste@@ ad@@ fast in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video gallery Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned with this difficult global point of time in which we are in .
&quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me an un@@ discovered Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things perhaps aw@@ aken remin@@ ders , as in all the inter@@ sections of our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Berkeley Bridge in Berkeley , conversations as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are held . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people through the work of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; contained in the public presentation , four decades even science of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other , &quot; as it is my girlfriend and me in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake feeds , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity
&quot; story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project the following applies :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are , to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often is connected to understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to , in order to appreciate , to soci@@ alize . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation will lead to the audience being able to listen to it . &quot;
they cry out laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his label , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ lines . &quot;

it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( the Civil Front for the No@@ de Test of Deb@@ t ) and the National Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debts have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Rico claims that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the sovereignty of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an anti @-@ government non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law of state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration bore the name &quot; Night of light for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign dedicated itself to the event . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is available here roy@@ alty free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up , and what are the real costs associated with it . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the mist that surro@@ unds our news feed and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was cancelled out of the A@@ dra prison directory , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book , with the title of collective remembrance , gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strict secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its location and state remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes was more pre@@ conceived than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to exter@@ min@@ ate this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world . &quot;
this strip in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , sharing his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom , and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology , and he taught me to use both computers and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners as to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is done &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; any of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I &apos;ll be in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; who I wear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
during operation
&quot; I in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release of port back on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption incident , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the Republic &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post , as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call this action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to put the director back in an interview with the Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach to dealing with the contrary .
&quot; the company seems to be silent , however , and does not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also decl@@ ines this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of which had served . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid presentations and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director of no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return mor@@ als and serve the state , * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as handy as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison not only to be remembered as the first independent president but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to all be able to sell the Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also similar : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he is making money , sets it again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î¹ volunte@@ ered ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored a lot of users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting .

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Out of Print &quot; , &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ ject con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word in itself does not automatically provoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cra@@ b ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cy@@ l@@ ator A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to rel@@ ieve his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question face ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several responses to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it wi@@ dens all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ et .
&quot; what it should do instead , carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ ect@@ ins &quot; &quot; ( sto@@ ols ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cut their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was reminded of this new Facebook Policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect , post and share content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; &quot; did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned the words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would have little more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks auto @-@ cens@@ orship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the web . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .

screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence , have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks aims to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the child
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that should ban this practice , so that the marriage @-@ ready age now lies at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organisation ( IR@@ O ) , said that the state was not supposed to interfere because that , age , is not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , which defines min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , striving to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; however , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite the 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained it - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it , and not one on the other . &quot;
&quot; after it had been decided in the Senate before , the design can now become the law . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the marriage network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ proof age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the amend@@ ment of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 parliam@@ ent@@ arians in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all members of the Parliament voted in favour of the law .
the child marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ like tur@@ ret .
many thanks to all activists who have fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook arrives in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take court action , the law should be passed , and he seems to let his promise now . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion as general , in a way that can only provoke panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters to protect them , would be mis@@ used , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or continues to be the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is call@@ able despite legal ban . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the barrier . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ pages , when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one attacks another URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia @-@ page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation
&quot; a succ@@ es@@ ful rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colours . &quot;
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera and try to stop the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , he described this first @-@ class situation in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started kne@@ eling pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature , and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood before face to the face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ kov@@ sky appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ats@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been re@@ published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India women avoid having the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm in order to preserve this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and the community after having addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not refer to the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less allow@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health guards and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , showing the Roh@@ ini in its discussion round , acted by women who do not call their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud , is a custom that they are all oblig@@ ated to maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not observe this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try out at home with her husband so far . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ?
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands about their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women could never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she was going to gig@@ gle up , and another decided to let out the whole an@@ ised fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation generated in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red Dot , if he did . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened with it to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not complete with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose , not to carry him on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we make an excursion with each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say some things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they are . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only supported Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini adorned her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming up : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot;
some women ta@@ sted it a few times but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and not other members of the family . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fid@@ dle around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people tell about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka told President of the private company Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; Today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . &quot;

the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if these &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the famous places connected with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you must absolutely visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road

pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went to London on a pilgrimage to London and walked across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base in a market @-@ oriented manner , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for one day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen @-@ no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;

smo@@ other men are drag@@ ged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the people that Gl@@ ory @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald @-@ headed people for the organ@@ ist , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange District , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a glass @-@ headed man can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia declared the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the mos@@ quit@@ ous police war@@ med up following the latest assass@@ ination of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange District , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police had already been following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; persec@@ utions and murder of smo@@ other individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the sacrifices in the head might have power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been killed with loss of hair in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty confron@@ ting Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like to encourage E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH , a country where people would have shame to go on the streets and would not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for imm@@ ac@@ ulate hum@@ our could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ eted that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a District , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both of them are : &quot;

we are deeply concerned about experiencing the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences towards his family , his friends and all those who have known and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand public access to the Internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who spent themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their man was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ que &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials heard that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we all have the honour of b@@ ass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or for@@ ci@@ bly disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions are exposed . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in custody , thus the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : Ne@@ ural Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently taken . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the former Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized in the final stage for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway two days
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway began to push after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she said in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it assi@@ sts him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person at the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere in the interven@@ ing and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7th and 8th .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Mexico
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide a proper medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;

Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France ( Italy )
&quot; in a statement on 29 June , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news of France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will take it in the end . &quot;
Taiwan &#124; Taiwan
&quot; on 27 June , China called on the Council of Land Affairs in Taiwan to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;

&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and weal@@ th@@ ier China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io blog accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this precious land , we hear that we are not in the end . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a compulsory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons presented by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re comes again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the week , the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests about our press , our jew@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ replies . &quot;
he clo@@ aked corresponding questions with non @-@ responses in a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing the commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the co@@ dex .
&quot; when he said Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ emic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integr@@ ates the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; fake a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; defending the land above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ? &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series of rum@@ ors covering certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan again and again . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ les on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would mistake me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means basically to be fun - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double @-@ man ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau stepped on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zes Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular music video published in Thailand has released a music video , which par@@ odi@@ ls the Jun@@ ta , which 2014 took power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to dominate the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man , who tells us what prescri@@ ptions makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band has been praised by many fans and other internet users for their bra@@ very to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the Video 1,@@ 254 magazine uploaded to Facebook and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these images of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , which monitors online content and individuals who were accused , the monarchy is le@@ ased , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand imple@@ ments a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ ha@@ zia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet expan@@ ses in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and the sett@@ lers are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called the ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in those ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are collap@@ sed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were congreg@@ ations , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded luxury buildings .
people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both of them seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the District Administration supplies candles and bread to the villages for free . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village fle@@ eing before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ sia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ hum@@ i ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will last a little , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has her own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha was kinder@@ garten once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
it tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation ends to the end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ ended buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of her childhood who care for in@@ authenticity in her life .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula ; it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of her name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather herself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez says , people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m which proceeds from the long journey exhausted . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to get to Boston where she will find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will get in contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone , to greet them or to report about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have added migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his work site . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to black@@ mail money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a solo @-@ drawing , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives and tries to decide where to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , travelers consult their phones quietly . &quot;
&quot; today , a mini@@ bus has arrived and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she flo@@ ats in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens , who made her a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have gone away . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which she assign@@ s the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , constra@@ ined ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme conditions and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the Media out@@ let based on Twitter published &quot; Images from the China , &quot; published cens@@ ored messages published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers random@@ ly checked whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the control technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( produced by G@@ ALL@@ ER@@ LAND ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can raise the requirement for a Windows operating system and thus get un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Council , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all governmental branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published a decree to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; in the local police register . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those which refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes its name all honor .
one that has sm@@ ashed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the cast , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of un@@ hei@@ rs . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the districts sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply ceased to function in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt courage@@ ously enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a gorgeous image that fully fulfilled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have cried all the way to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear also how you are writing &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
and you trust what to look in my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father equal to that . &quot;
&quot; his father equ@@ als with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is to me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was subjected for months . &quot;
I crossed the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself . &quot;
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eal all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share them with just one other prisoner , and I must immediately set myself up without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I picked up a tried @-@ and @-@ tried communication method , beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; first chief &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a rep@@ utable man of middle aged , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness there are no striking facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers neg@@ ate his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to disp@@ el all these crow@@ s on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of spo@@ il@@ age until I saw the yellow light that presented us to the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( such as : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; thus , the secret was lifted : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the betra@@ yal and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ board and betra@@ yed the close attention of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ive from him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join these days and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am used to not responding .
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to pun@@ ish myself or badly , although I did not do anything to make this punishment happen . &quot;
in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry had not yet been enough , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them changed as I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not find any favour , so that he was next to an electri@@ cally charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply around my entire district . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the floor , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
that must have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours went , which happened to me as a few minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ fu@@ cian . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible worries . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be l@@ ayed . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian rap@@ pers Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he turns to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or her with ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ i@@ ye@@ en ( such as : farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who opposed the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also demands the heart of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can feel the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he will have a special reluc@@ tance to U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian &quot; wing of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and so far has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he dissolved in water Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot jun@@ ta has little to do with protest against Islam .
&quot; basically speaking , the sm@@ ells of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ dar@@ s of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink in the public during Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary dep@@ u@@ ties supporting the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the deputy and former press spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the old @-@ tried legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simple rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan that appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned to his body by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women who have for@@ et@@ old sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently lower unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; honor@@ ary kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan has failed to support the institutional infrastructure in order to support women victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to fight crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can often be det@@ ained in prison , and their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman will not have anything to happen . &quot;
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music that is full of explicit all@@ usions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics in@@ filtr@@ ated me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn out of the context and had been cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only one edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not part of Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ die , a poet of the eighth century , who remained in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service arrested several former members of government and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they had critical comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now rever@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will res@@ ign and therefore also resist . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting by A@@ man as Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of Japan &apos;s 3 biggest festivals .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the fe@@ at , drums and dancing march over more than a thousand years ago , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to snap a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are straight to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only real thing - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outw@@ ard appearances and body @-@ care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from the crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the Fris@@ eurs . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rau@@ ts and illegal drug trade are everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the contest of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for children . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ schaften an Guer@@ illa fighters , &quot; &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way , until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried out their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who will then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more urgently . &quot;
&quot; he tar@@ ried , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent encour@@ agement . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history into a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters were living ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pen , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him firmly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice appeared on the part of the Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I often had seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ ano@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to use weapons , lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . to those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are subjected to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ite above the LGB@@ T@@ Q community does not come about overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested bi@@ quit@@ ous qu@@ eer men and plug@@ ged them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she sens@@ ed that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the last analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as volunteer hel@@ per at a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , no thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally wo@@ ke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances were you laid , in which the men or the women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for that , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; some told me I must prove it by running above without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have cup Size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number@@ ing sign with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you put in . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; on gender equality , however , we do not speak , that is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an items still carry me in myself .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really b@@ other to look at how the person looks at it from her past - so to my male shape . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have been dor@@ man@@ t ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has saved one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there are not so many . &quot;
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives , in order to put Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alize itself . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a sup@@ position or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . but we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else could it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation , already held in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Great Britain when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; civil engineering &quot; , &quot; but ultimately it has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked , I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wearing red@@ ness jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never just curved a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating . &quot;
OC Media : which activities are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ efs , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up influ@@ enza .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam before the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think with transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th caused the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered anxiety , depression and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability of his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family members , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families because of their persecution by the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is systematically ref@@ using to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused in the region and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who were looking for a job , completed primary school , ended 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is deprived of access to job opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and published originally on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves across the many different countries and denom@@ inations . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , when I &apos;m referring to skin color , on racism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists left . &quot;
&quot; however , everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of racial seg@@ reg@@ ated violence , which we are subjected to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with an immig@@ rant background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all males and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman whose center is the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which refers to both sex and skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women , and again and again . &quot;
&quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dis@@ em@@ bodied and margin@@ alised nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism instead of putting myself into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embar@@ k on the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) says that we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped which constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has not passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported in@@ significant about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kurdist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work is on persec@@ uted , poor@@ ly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # prof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has gone by and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for abuse , the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also used nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever display advertisements at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; accounting and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ ations and a legal system , which has nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and stat@@ s &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ arming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were committed to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman , which is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , will come to two women who do not do this , &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an independent criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then she had to rep@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she carried out psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ missive because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the ill treatment of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their posts , among them Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she didn &apos;t like the so long of Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with mental abuse .
&quot; after all , her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it mainly focused on money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for@@ eigner ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law envis@@ ages to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish tough@@ er , as is already the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the legislative text has been modified in some points in order to also win dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ is@@ hable by up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original draft bill fores@@ ees most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to refund ad and receive a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators run away . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se so long ad until abuse is no longer regarded as normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , parts of the law had been altered , including a passage which the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes will go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a big set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision of the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Dominican authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he f@@ ates a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other Az@@ am@@ n editors , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has suffered , in addition to his role as the sole Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , Chief Command , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domin@@ ion of the sul@@ tan is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially of domestic intelligence , public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , to restrict and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces of I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level civil servants in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure to judge the Supreme Court of Oman in order to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; issued on 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo credit : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was charged by the ISS prior to the special department and was arrested by the security forces on his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS arrested the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper was banned in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were condemned , among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i , however , acqu@@ itted the Appe@@ als Court on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he f@@ ates his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Dominican government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further statement in which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister announced another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to reg@@ ain the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Roman authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Roman authorities : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial chic@@ an@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather together peac@@ efully , and provides them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all . it is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : for a lack of global healthcare , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , the research carried out by African scientists itself helps to build up own research capacities in Africa . a larger role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself studied at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think about the important current scientific issues in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw back here , because the financing and the opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles exist in your routine research work you previously did not have ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed , things to do , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise to challenge here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that periodic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s article was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was made only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned with food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still re@@ alizes let@@ tu@@ ce , but he now needs longer because his work is more and more complicated by more and more limitations . &quot;
it is as if there are a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to bog@@ gle down .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand trial , no one can breed a new kind of salad , because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; re@@ ins ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit to others that others can freely use the seed bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and it is not immediately apparent - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many vegetable pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to the seed , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , the rights of the farmers , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by bred seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the open source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others . thus , their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available Gen@@ pool due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always available , shrink un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are still patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders increases by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more important at present than ever since the changing conditions are much worse predic@@ able due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company advoc@@ ates the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property holds other breeders , as patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the other way : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it becomes impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton bot@@ hers to patented plant features : &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. State Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; anyone who breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , which breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents ) , they manage to survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for sage in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders are becoming more innovative by the avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my ri@@ vals are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , it is protected from competition , with which it makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a form@@ id@@ able and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bree@@ der in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( F ) stands for Fac@@ ts , ( S ) for Stud@@ ents &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and ( A ) for the opinion of the al@@ um@@ ni . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; a statement , however , is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting crops . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , scheduled to fall for the official launch next year . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is cultivated and seed systems hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network released a comment on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true despite this attack and the ri@@ dic@@ ation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to keep these goals further , it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , including the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web site lock@@ ings to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ D@@ S@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt anymore . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles he writes for in@@ accessible web pages and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also Zi@@ ffy blog is native , on the other hand , is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and watched a video , as police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada expressed himself through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of del@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog is probably not significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; an arrest , an attempt to murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to avoid cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave ones go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; documented the blocking of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offered began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that the Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which has no legal basis for the Egyptian population , using them to act against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers report newspapers throughout Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe uns@@ killed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ government organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; newspaper , known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new category called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper :
&quot; all that happens by the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; hurt more than it is used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as well demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , enligh@@ tenment and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the Rio de Janeiro federal state is larger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot;
none of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mur@@ als per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is an extra member of the company , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police report and permanently station@@ ed a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent death . for several years , however , the U@@ PP took over chic@@ an@@ uts and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an in@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; mis@@ placed balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , Fak@@ t is that the inhabitants of fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , the police came up with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit merchant died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : teach Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently approximately one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of research by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these controlled areas outside Damascus have been si@@ ege under si@@ ege , which led residents to local or through tunnels and control points of sm@@ ug@@ gling food . &quot;
&quot; due to the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics will teach East G@@ hou@@ ta residents how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Direct of the Project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , which has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o until Monday , September 04 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ supply by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege can be seen . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017 &apos; fires
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many provincial capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were in the middle of the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called out a state of state for the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 people .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 alone 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :
that &apos;s Br@@ aga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Br@@ aga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the federation of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did this not nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought about serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;

&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light fire@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems include that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th October , as residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it took advantage of their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the Fire Brig@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers did not stand up to the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot;

the path from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

in one night in autumn 1994 the conqu@@ ering of Afghanistan started by the Taliban .
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ qi Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , always came closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal mine for a couple of years . the work was difficult and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his minor salary , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than he himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous voyage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ qi came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy has a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high probability quot@@ as , but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre , if they have officially requested an application for asylum - which can still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum request . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ b@@ anded li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ qi put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ limb@@ o .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury , a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years some of Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the different Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek jud@@ gments . &quot;
the Afghan employers Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ qi has also made plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ qi has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; Dat@@ alogic Report : dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in detention for over 900 days . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ural report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian Parliament scrut@@ in@@ izes a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority .
&quot; users should be able to use social networks within six months following successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
&quot; whoever missed this step , could be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was adver@@ tised by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament filed a proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officer . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took control of Egyptian polic@@ emen , who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 demonstr@@ ators , who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May because the prison line failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; the death penalty threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ pers@@ eded murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza hosted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ian activists inter@@ rog@@ ated to through @-@ feed documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ rog@@ ated with an aw@@ ful action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who expressly endor@@ ses a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they all return illeg@@ ally received mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at casts a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislative template will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press court , which sec@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on the 9th of May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that the registration will be necessary with the full real name . &quot;
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only sel@@ ectively asser@@ t these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the state government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites include websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ z.@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ as@@ ti@@ tion Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to , the site was blocked because it became &quot; an information source working with groups to address a political diff@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , besides , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop moving around
&quot; following this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
