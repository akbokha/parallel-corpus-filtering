<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very cleric love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and publicly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in comments for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominees."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I was unable to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps of intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. d.): as much as" cassertion of the whites against all other ethnicities "; word game of white in reference to the whites and Whiplash, as it called the Great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the White Americas of this promise and says:" Hell with diversity, freedom of religion, and the whole concept of pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again on the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>

<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now a bumps country," "said the news."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cataca together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played at both places, has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope for hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turtle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, timberhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cataca - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste materials:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cataca, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as Favio something that he had never seen before, a violin made out of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people of Catalya, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law crusher of this kind at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles swiftly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "all of a sudden the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior co-worker of the Kenyan fishery authority."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of looting of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 initiated by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the Premier out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand for each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is not regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect. thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very aware of the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify the ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered, such as those that indicate that a ship will load his caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports, which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of nfds Africa. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen entering into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, among other things, actions include like sailing under false flag, fake license documents, indication of phantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a lack of organized control system, "says Long." in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You must not run my port'. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to Me'." "and exactly this legal hole hole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has followed and found fleeting vessels."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to make suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that links various levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find agprising ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and by which the position of any traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there is evidence that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, who used to fish without a license earlier and hardly had any consequences, now know they are being observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile gained a 33% increase in fisheries revenue, since then fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board, whose use was prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiilu says." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined forces with the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "Security is the aim to further develop more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia had to report its first great triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was traveling under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the cosmos.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are deemed to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the office of the President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also run in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland region of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north of the Bundestag Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which becomes apparent in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by acute lack of food and medicine."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the office of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the refusal of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine was held, the referendum was held for many as the only way to regain its institutional structures and to conclude a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="201">"the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was investigated for crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I believed that this was fine."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torture and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was in prison La Perla from 1976 to 1978."</seg>

<seg id="213">"no, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had seen as a boy, and who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father."</seg>

<seg id="217">Everybody called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok.</seg>
<seg id="226">"at the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spawed in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found that they were attached to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person who was trapped just there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, injecting him with water and hunted him a load of 220 Volt into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was appalling... as a dirty vass.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can harm another so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where prisoners were chained with handcuffs and were wearing eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men lay with the face downwards - all were captivated by hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people were sitting quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What guckest thou so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero assembled a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names have been changed and they were assigned as part of the process of dehumanizing a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came from above that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - Euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war-yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military myself, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or maybe military badges that one has fought against an enemy whom you have fought."</seg>

<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I said," "You who were driving cars on the street?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>

<seg id="284">That was my father.</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he nevertheless brought clothes back home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to cancel.</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, so you executed people during the dictatorship. but why the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>

<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been possible to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families with whom they could pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="308">Only to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of displaying my father arose during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him reproaches for all the atrocities that I had to experience.</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese City Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving license, last month witnesses to a very particularly miserable translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign the Japanese word, which was" "older driver", "was falsely, but perhaps also with vicious hind thank & # 8212; as" "awful motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">"the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself, from 1st to 20th September."</seg>
<seg id="350">"adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was often shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was made to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">Kyoto Shimbun writes in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the defective English translation was first removed. the name" "drivers" "(German:" "terrible drivers" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, which are involved nationwide in accidents, is quite an occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"Kyoto prefecture, for example, was caused in 2005 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors. this corresponds to a percentage of 10%."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate from English to French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies don't employ people with English as their native language, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign employees, can still produce translations in the company-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and puzzling propositions, which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this applies especially to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but by large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="394">"other online channels contributed recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by oppositional groups, which opposed the government Nicolás Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the duties of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>

<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes her under-old son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children will have to pay for countless days of housework which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice designated as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society, and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude which is vaccinated in the Crimean tas is generally not silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family that their daughter is in the belief that they are able to finish their education, improve their position in society and" make something out of themselves, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl with him and justifies his exploitation with faith, gives them a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck a stick on Marín as long as she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the Criadazgo practice deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>

<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they cleaned the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to hunger, but she didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the refrigerator, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently approved a bill on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is adopted by the Parliament, users and users of social media must register in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of accepting the law, users should register with their correct names and ID numbers on the site to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months" imprisonment or a cash-buckle. "</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consisting of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent curses, defines social media as" any application running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video judge and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are to make up the registration. unclear is also how they should account those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the stage of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, deputy and promoter of the bill of law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password from the Office of Telecommunications to get through the firewall, which blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to establish a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of them, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" conductive research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for personal rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine it is just as they are forcefully controlling physical public and private spaces that could be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" stands in accordance with a pro-military way of thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviant narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal conservator Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost of the Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"among the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor), a subtype of the larger family of the Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor) belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video, the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild game is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza likes to passionately reveal another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the northeastern Japan-based daily Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was a prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate have been forcibly evacuated, since the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the prefecture of Fukushima still had a nuclear accident, already that alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">"the report provides detailed information on Mergers and Acquisitions, Equity / Debt Offerings, Private Equity, Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period."</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses were completed (in the district of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, one still tries to relocate six years after the catastrophe, Evacuation of Behind Parents (Govetsu julieaku) to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the 2011 evacuation from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuees residing after the disaster were resettled into final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is 34 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by the disaster, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of marine fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, have been affected large-scale in the three prefectures of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused on the situation of the Evacuation from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-causing, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"in early 2016, some more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 level, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuation systems, which are still in Behel underlined hausen, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it by Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, Workshoppers launched mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstar."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop will make the young participants discuss topics like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-activity "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the Sursumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a street section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences through globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar Hip-Hop group who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as well a translation into English, translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our scream.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"this way, they can grow and go forward to our youth."</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what it meant to the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the comments section, the reader and proponent of the Cree language, Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the verse to syllable script (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, you can see sculptural dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plasma Models of the Courts" ") are displayed by any dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of small companies that produce those sculptural dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic grounded mobile phone tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigeration magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerated magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say," "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing." ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic rubbers can also assume a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"further skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow us on Twitter the hashtag #," Schedule "Schedule" Schedule "Schedule"</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the criminals and drinks regularly dip into statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, fully pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communities that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind each bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" learning to live with drug trade ") giving these victims a voice and stories of people who were caught in the battle between the enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime is not only a fear of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video titled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for secret tombs according to his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not get paid out because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the perpetrators when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they would pollute those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by being" "permanent". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to persuade them to be spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months of extortion in the main city district: "how a family was pillaged with threats." in this, she describes how armed criminals discarded money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also tore their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain over it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are apart from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when to kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by force."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born as Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence caused by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the Ombudsman for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this equals to an average of 8.5 acres per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 created the data journalism project Narcodata whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something gone up for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false pairing between image and event -" false description "or" wrong context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tanker traversed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, he fell victim to that of the refuelling trolleys."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped including a cinema nearby that was full of people who viewed the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and carbonated corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "This is Nigeria". "by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Multiple photos of the incident form the gruesome scene of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of chartered bodies lying on the floor while individuals are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been erased several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 combatants of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "said a man to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be displayed figuratively."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:"</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of depreciation; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, such as this example, mistakenly put the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to supply arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported by the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this image originates from an acidic Arab message that falsely claimed that the President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians would have taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to depict this information."</seg>

<seg id="918">"the picture was weathered for the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Chinese), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message that was allegedly written by an" "father Juan Carlos Martos" "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it a falsification."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the message, in which the image of the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Clarettin missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos invoked."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images can be used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper issue, however, is what happens if readers cannot believe these images any longer."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water surrounding a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is to acknowledge the tragedy. at times, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern that forcibly images and viewers desensitize readers and viewers and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media seem to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss with violent presentations in the news media, it is true that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from the context or completely abusive."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, every study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017, several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in mass demonstration with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place on 3 April 2017 in a mass demonstration; the march began at the Pueranian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (the Civil Front for the Node Test of Debt) and the National Assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debts have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Rico claims that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial review and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be reconciled with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>

<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Center for New Economy, "an anti-government non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law of state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state of state."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is available here royalty free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up, and what are the real costs associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the mist that surrounds our news feed and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was cancelled out of the Adra prison directory, where he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book, with the title of collective remembrance, gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, was transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strict secret "command of the military tribunal of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its location and state remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more preconceived than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to exterminate this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, sharing his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom, and bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">"Bassel opened the door to the technology, and he taught me to use both computers and smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners as to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption incident, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Republic's Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call this action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to put the director back in an interview with the Deutsche Welle."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach to dealing with the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company seems to be silent, however, and does not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also declines this behaviour and considers the case as" disgusting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of which had served."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid presentations and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence."</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing to return morals and serve the state, * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served itself by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as handy as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>

<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censuses the word" "Kalar" "or," "Out of Print", "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abject connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "Kalar" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically provoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written on Burmesan even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(crab),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocylator Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "Healing" "(ku) + the question face (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several responses to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it widens all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook doesn't delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>

<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Hectins" "(stools) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spread hate speech, get a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was reminded of this new Facebook Policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect, post and share content for 24 hours because the mail" "Facebook Community Standards" "did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned the words such as" chair "or" peas curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would have little more respect for the 15 million benefit, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>

<seg id="1391">"the English-language Wikipedia-page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened."</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use enveloping tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship by Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"however, the content is callable despite legal ban."</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also admitted that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrorpages, when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"one attacks another URL, which is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia-page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera and try to stop the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"on Facebook, he described this first-class situation in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature, and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know [it], for he stood before face to the face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>

<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Bukovsky appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyatsa and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women avoid having the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm in order to preserve this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian State Odisha by a false court and rejected by her family and the community after having addressed a married relatives with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not refer to the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less allowances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health guards and housewives, came to a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage, up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, showing the Rohini in its discussion round, acted by women who do not call their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud, is a custom that they are all obligated to maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not observe this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to try out at home with her husband so far."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent?</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their husbands about their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women could never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise she was going to giggle up, and another decided to let out the whole anised frustration against him and his family by cursing it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation generated in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberRed Dot, if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened with it to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not complete with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose, not to carry him on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make an excursion with each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say some things loudly, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, that's okay, but some wanted a salwas-Kurta to wear a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini adorned her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming up:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only made small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and not other members of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fiddle around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people tell about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who experience it themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report about global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1591">"another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>

<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the former Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized in the final stage for liver cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for" "Subversion" "(state endangering) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China referred to Lius as an" "internal affair" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"a spokesman, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway two days</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway began to push after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as she said in a statement on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife as well as family members."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also free his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the call of the US Embassy drew a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" no country has the right to interfere in the intervening and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release rights for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France (Italy)</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and wealthier China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem silly, since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, with most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the Cavalierio blog accused the Minister of Justice," turning the logic "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this precious land, we hear that we are not in the end."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a compulsory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons presented by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre comes again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"at the end of the week, the final week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests about our press, our jewdictative, our political system really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He cloaked corresponding questions with non-responses in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to elucidate this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing the commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said Singapore is rather a" city "as a country," he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said Singapore" "be no country," "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "fake a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "defending the land above all", "but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">"recently, Global Voices asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home country or homeland?"</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series of rumors covering certain parts of the world and to be shown another facet.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">"the question that is most asked me in Japan is:" "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answered. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live in Japan again and again. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may cook wardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maples on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"we obviously say very often" "sorry." ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends that I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter if you would mistake me for example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means basically to be fun - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" "The Simpsons" "(who has an own Canadian double-man)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau stepped on stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a popular music video published in Thailand has released a music video, which parodils the Junta, which 2014 took power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to dominate the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">"the new song" Dictator Girl "(Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man, who tells us what prescriptions makes his girlfriend."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band has been praised by many fans and other internet users for their bravery to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"in the first three days alone, the Video 1,254 magazine uploaded to Facebook and received 8,800 likes."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these images of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of girls "may refer to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program of" "change of imagination" "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are viewed as critics by the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, which monitors online content and individuals who were accused, the monarchy is leased, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand implements a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, the law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d'etat of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut from" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by putsch-opponents during the protests in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called the ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico," Mama Africa "houses migrants on their long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula; it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in a teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of her name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather herself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez says, people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm which proceeds from the long journey exhausted."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghee) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to get to Boston where she will find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"as the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will get in contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone, to greet them or to report about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have added migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work site."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to blackmail money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a solo-drawing, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives and tries to decide where to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travelers consult their phones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"today, a minibus has arrived and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she floats in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair lichens, who made her a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which she assigns the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the communication, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" "remote control" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, constrained ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme conditions and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Media outlet based on Twitter published" Images from the China, "published censored messages published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers randomly checked whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the control technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China "(produced by GALLERLAND) also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can raise the requirement for a Windows operating system and thus get unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Council, to minimize the spread of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all governmental branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office at the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published a decree to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards "in the local police register."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those which refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1995">"far away from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognisable, both inside and outside."</seg>

<seg id="1998">One that has smashed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but if the reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the cast, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth moves on the axis of unheirs. it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the boss of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "screams."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the districts sought, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I didn't put high demands on a city that is stuffed up into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had a little calmed down after the power supply ceased to function in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"a few minutes later, some of my friends felt courageously enough to find together."</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, real friends joined me; we joined us to a gorgeous image that fully fulfilled my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp, but it simply does not interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice, after you have cried all the way to the office of security service from the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan starts to speak:" "let me hear also how you are writing 'Allahu Akbar', or you are brave enough to scream if we are not near."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you trust what to look in my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never ceased to look into the eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed proposition is to me up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture, which I was subjected for months."</seg>

<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with just one other prisoner, and I must immediately set myself up without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell and I picked up a tried-and-tried communication method, beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-comrade was a "" first chief "." "</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>

<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness there are no striking facial features, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>

<seg id="2055">"thus, the secret was lifted: to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the betrayal and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational blackboard and betrayed the close attention of their world view."</seg>

<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that derive from him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life than to join these days and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am used to not responding.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer tell exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to punish myself or badly, although I did not do anything to make this punishment happen."</seg>

<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>

<seg id="2070">"my cry had not yet been enough, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector earlier, or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a giant cable."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply around my entire district."</seg>

<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours went, which happened to me as a few minutes."</seg>

<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can feel the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he will have a special reluctance to U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a" Palestinian "wing of the second generation," he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and so far has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," "Hdaib stresses."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," "while he dissolved in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee on a scorching hot junta has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically speaking, the smells of lukewarm coffee and the radars of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink in the public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary deputies supporting the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputy and former press spokesman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the old-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simple rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan that appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to his body by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women who have foretold sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently lower unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of" "honorary killings" "- the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan has failed to support the institutional infrastructure in order to support women victims of murders or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fight crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can often be detained in prison, and their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that the woman will not have anything to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music that is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics infiltrated me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed", "Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to memorize that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was only one edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not part of Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nudie, a poet of the eighth century, who remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service arrested several former members of government and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they had critical comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now revered Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will resign and therefore also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the feat, drums and dancing march over more than a thousand years ago, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the contest of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monanove.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" "Liebesbotschaften an Guerilla fighters," "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"isn't it much more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga of the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians there is still a long way, until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more urgently."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he tarried, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent encouragement."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history into a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the policy student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters were living), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL pen, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him firmly and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the starvation." "I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice appeared on the part of the Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people I often had seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commandant of Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monanove, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to use weapons, lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. to those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who arrested biquitous queer men and plugged them into secret prisons in argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she sensed that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the last analysis."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as volunteer helper at a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the lap through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long will you honor the family, you scandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, no thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which ambulances were you laid, in which the men or the women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"for that, I am very grateful to him."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"some told me I must prove it by running above without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was only bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup Size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with darkened window panes and a numbering sign with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without identification, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message:" you don't believe you're in security, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you put in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"on gender equality, however, we do not speak, that is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian items still carry me in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really bother to look at how the person looks at it from her past - so to my male shape."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have been dormant?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has saved one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there are not so many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives, in order to put Kadyrow's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there, so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but submerged in order to radicalize itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a supposition or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. but we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belong to a so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation, already held in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Great Britain when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "civil engineering", "but ultimately it has thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked, I had dyed eyelashes, wearing redness jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never just curved a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had laughed and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activities are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreefs, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up influenza.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy to you with foam before the mouth, that there are no coils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think with transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the past few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th caused the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered anxiety, depression and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all family members, who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families because of their persecution by the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime is systematically refusing to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused in the region and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who were looking for a job, completed primary school, ended 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti-Arab discrimination:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to job opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I don't identify myself with feminism even with the intersectional</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and published originally on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves across the many different countries and denominations."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, when I'm referring to skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists left."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and sing 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racial segregated violence, which we are subjected to black women in a twofold way."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with an immigrant background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all males and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as a black woman whose center is the white woman who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers to both sex and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women, and again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a disembodied and marginalised nature."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the Movement of Womanism instead of putting myself into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embark on the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) says that we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has not passed, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine reported insignificant about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be republished here."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan area in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "Musa says."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, which uses and works to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of their work is on persecuted, poorly observed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with their help suppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" "by Kurtural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# proflicheinefraubin), which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time has gone by and the police said that her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another Mrs. Balbuena pointed out for abuse, the accurate display of Ada Báez also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever display advertisements at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"accounting and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreations and a legal system, which has nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays Law: good approach, lack of implementation impacts and stats"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecutor's Office opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were committed to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman, which is refunded because of physical abuse, will come to two women who do not do this," she stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an independent criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want to do it, but then she had to repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she carried out psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they deceive themselves of violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the ill treatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their posts, among them Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she didn't like the so long of Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it mainly focused on money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays Law: good approach, lack of implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a way full of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# foreigner)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NononeWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"the original draft of the law envisages to declare Femizid to an independent criminal record and to punish tougher, as is already the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text has been modified in some points in order to also win deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punishable by up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original draft bill foresees most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must bear the victims of violence at present, if they just want to refund ad and receive a safe accommodation to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">"Echauri argues that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:"</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the dominion of the sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially of domestic intelligence, public freedoms, including press freedom, to restrict and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens, also activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline."</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia</seg>
<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all. it is a growing area, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: for a lack of global healthcare, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, the research carried out by African scientists itself helps to build up own research capacities in Africa. a larger role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself studied at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambian healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think about the important current scientific issues in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a maker."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw back here, because the financing and the opportunities for development are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles exist in your routine research work you previously did not have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it's the limited speed, things to do, and the more difficult access to scientific expertise to challenge here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that periodicals make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" paywall "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's article was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was made only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned with food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still realizes lettuce, but he now needs longer because his work is more and more complicated by more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if there are a boulder in a river that I have to boggle down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand trial, no one can breed a new kind of salad, because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" reins).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the variety Outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the open source Seed Initiative (initiative for" open source "seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit to others that others can freely use the seed bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and it is not immediately apparent - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many vegetable patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to the seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, the rights of the farmers, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by bred seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the open source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others. thus, their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available Genpool due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always available, shrink unceasingly."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are still patented as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders increases by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more important at present than ever since the changing conditions are much worse predicable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company advocates the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property holds other breeders, as patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other way: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain:" independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it becomes impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton bothers to patented plant features:" "we do not really create the features themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. State Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" anyone who breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (those who are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents), they manage to survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for sage in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders are becoming more innovative by the avoidance of plant patents:" "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my rivals are selling my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent for 20 years, it is protected from competition, with which it makes it easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formidable and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(F) stands for Facts, (S) for Students' opinion, (P) for Professor's opinion and (A) for the opinion of the alumni."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, stated that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"a statement, however, is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting crops."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for" Open Source "seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, scheduled to fall for the official launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is cultivated and seed systems hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider with whom also Ziffy blog is native, on the other hand, is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and watched a video, as police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook commentary, Ziada expressed himself through the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to lock blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of deldelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blog is probably not significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a siege of siege; an arrest, an attempt to murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I didn't write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post items to avoid censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"documented the blocking of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offered began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that the Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which has no legal basis for the Egyptian population, using them to act against these acts."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers report newspapers throughout Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "Diebe unskilled pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-government organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" "Extra" "newspaper, known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio, published the editorial" "That's not normal" "in which she announced to set up a new category called" "War in Rio". ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"all that happens by the civilized standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the category" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" hurt more than it is used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as well demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, enlightenment and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the Rio de Janeiro federal state is larger than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is an extra member of the company, which, like Cecília, has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a favela by using a massive police report and permanently stationed a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent death. for several years, however, the UPP took over chicanuts and repressions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under fire."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently approximately one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>

<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of research by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these controlled areas outside Damascus have been siege under siege, which led residents to local or through tunnels and control points of smuggling food."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics will teach East Ghouta residents how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Direct of the Project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, which has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more" awareness. ""</seg>

<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"due to the fuel scarcity, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began with the" "production of mushrooms from the regions", "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a bigger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many provincial capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were in the middle of the week before in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called out a state of state for the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 people.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country, and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 alone 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the federation of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought about serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity from case to fall, if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built, João Sorval will continue in the same article in the newspaper Público."</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light fireable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems include that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th October, as residents sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it took advantage of their own civil protection data using the fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the Fire Brigade and, on this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers did not stand up to the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a couple of years. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his minor salary, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than he himself, to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous voyage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharqi came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time was Asharaf homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy has a second chance for expired asylum seekers due to relatively high probability quotas, but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre, if they have officially requested an application for asylum - which can still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum request."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbanded lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years working in the construction industry for several years, Asharqi put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2915">"over the past few years some of Afghans have been created, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took control of Egyptian policemen, who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, like more than 700 demonstrators, who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in jail for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May because the prison line failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"the death penalty threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and superseded murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza hosted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya place in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>

<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, on the website of Nawaat casts a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislative template will look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian press court, which secures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on the 9th of May as a witness."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
