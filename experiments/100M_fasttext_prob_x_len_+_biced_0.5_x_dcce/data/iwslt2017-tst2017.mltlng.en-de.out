this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally sur@@ passed designs for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if it sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has as@@ cer@@ tained against the Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Am@@ end@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave , which they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though for years it is essential that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing and ris@@ king , they could also do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone number secret , &quot;
&quot; as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel advice with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional sentence because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on them all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take this from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which did not exist when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot collect information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ f@@ ps such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to make mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental contribut@@ or who will report alert to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t , or a Wall street insi@@ der that warned us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks again .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; this week . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers can go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now sounds like the plot of an agent or John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that be what should happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle in which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data sheet from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is less information needed in some U.S. states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a home , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all the up to a lawyer made suggestions for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we must change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ b@@ ble , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I see that things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot;
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been participating in central regi@@ sters at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this kind of transparency by laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made a deposit sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild alien sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , at the tips of toes to the door , and shut my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art , which he bought from me , is now hanging in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold as strangers in my childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ough , my ro@@ ommate shares and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create it , to turn fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something . our apartment is becoming a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and so called &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets were completely different , because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door came to the lock , Brian gaz@@ ed and I started . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came to the re@@ els .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can invite other people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you &apos;ll be mind@@ ful of the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the total experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a difference ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we stro@@ ve .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone from your left ro@@ ommate .
this sof@@ tly p@@ airing of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; this way , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who is now Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ elling to the President &apos;s Office ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told , wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you would have to hand off your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens the confidence decis@@ i@@ vely .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had left their ratings before we presented them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are related to age and residence . &quot;
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust most people who are the most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through jud@@ gments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems out common simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you expect from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example , &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- the request will not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I &apos;m doing business with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can one create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; what we did not reck@@ on was the great multitude of people , who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a requirement that had not been un@@ covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate or devast@@ ate homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; I stood at the front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem ever . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , it can be wonderful . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know well . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is about economic trading here .
&quot; but now just call the &quot; &quot; le@@ asing industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade which promises human relations .
people lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait a lot to fill a thoroughly and show one in a Knei@@ pent@@ tour district , of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would shape apartments for the sake of sharing ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to make society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and sealing . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place of residence ;
&quot; were taught to people whose children were dra@@ fted , and there were incub@@ ator programs started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a foreign or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospit@@ ability has already existed before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
why exactly did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we could use for design soon . &quot;
thanks again .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or just a delay in the security che@@ que at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims was negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read him , he thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you fully , and yet loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking announcement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should one do such things ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember -- when we went sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Muslim organizations , who said , &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t judge you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather together for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims into the free and defeated . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I &apos;ve got the rage of people down to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to be self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and make mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks again !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ ners and Olymp@@ ion@@ aries . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; maybe a few parking spaces will stop , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not being radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the radic@@ alisation process , one has found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors her behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group such as the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would fit into their imagination , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks again !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , it does not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that allows them to read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their anger , it was a main aim for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts , which they promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m brought back the connection with God and their church .
&quot; instead of bl@@ aming them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned at the mos@@ que , she told her to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we are afraid of at least three things happen .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit messages , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they voted for military attacks on Muslim lands and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we feel it may be the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the allocation of collective guilt , it is not only about self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a young man accomplished out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we moved sil@@ ently , with high pressure at the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and put off my shoes , and went into the building @-@ hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m expressed an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests ; for half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to join us but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I was collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought @-@ maker with drau@@ ght are working in a noble think tank , i.e. an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no way am I an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a billion dollar business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ pack@@ ets drive into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by joining forces , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the narrow@@ est space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it needs to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest eb@@ ony , e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to hit two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can vibr@@ ate , and has great advantages for starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences like wind @-@ bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts , which get together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ d@@ der . &quot;
recently we discovered that flies with only one work .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to properly throw it properly . &quot;
&quot; the chance to disc@@ ard it right , if all look at me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in trouble , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary capacity , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form it in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cled around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not put them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events at first .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves which arise through coloured black holes . &quot;
most of them considered them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes passed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than that :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a sp@@ lice in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a really alpine dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ oned by us at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff to be crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome .
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you by several points . &quot;
&quot; in tones , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain qualities such as sound and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now talks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; when the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like this : w@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; No one who knows what to hear , recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 Suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practically or fundamentally -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ice stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low . &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that in all things that we have never seen , which we have never seen and of whom we have never seen . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the nature of stars that bring black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ ckers for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and the cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks again .
some time ago I ta@@ sted an experiment .
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; Yes , &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if I made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I start to play with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I feared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected item . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an ast@@ o@@ unding side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things look like you are considering life .

I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are produced simultaneously . &quot;
each consi@@ gn@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 Million Dollar TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires all around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;

I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; I tell it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , country or classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just sitting on the computer and fanta@@ sies , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I get into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you can run a high note , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a sw@@ amp starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I speak about writing that writing makes me happy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , you do it . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working with television production , when I began working and working and working , creating , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive other than for size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the h@@ um .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more work there is , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more my expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high note , the bu@@ zz , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ laid , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is one only institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sw@@ amp ceased . &quot;
the mar@@ sh of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the h@@ um did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps not , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a Pre @-@ Show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you work , one loves what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you already knew the bu@@ zz , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan Poker ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; South @-@ States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things are made aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz bet@@ ters , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the bu@@ zz , I cannot do anything except to be careful . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land I create , the Marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high note - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and dam@@ p k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes to releasing , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me tri@@ ggers .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the h@@ um , but a sw@@ amp . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no mystery . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the work @-@ sum , the title of the title , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real h@@ um is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; genuine hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for what God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as easy as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would prefer to work as home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
NT@@ F &amp; C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Co @-@ Star Â ®
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe meets me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
&quot; and talking about my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , you do not need it anymore . &quot;
everyone can get up 15 minutes on a track even on a bad @-@ whi@@ m @-@ day !
15 minutes on the track !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that will make children ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for his peace @-@ peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is doing well .
find out and save it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will leave and I will win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz ; the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the Sum@@ ma of Love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is clear to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , which is going to go to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the cum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , I consider you to live . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby , one im@@ pl@@ ets an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the shift circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ or and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help yourself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that the brain oscill@@ ates the brain and the skull pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it possible . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed for a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fo@@ etus stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source allowing brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly how it did Jean @-@ François &quot;
and then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we planted them on the same individual as the exception of the same individual . &quot;
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t - aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we ran@@ ged the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were removed again , they go back home . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we joined an injury and stimul@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained unchanged -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been m@@ eri@@ zed .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we passed the motor motor area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , they see the monkeys that spontane@@ ously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rei@@ m@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Fr . Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I am sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill approximately two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments , and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ centric study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable geography .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy disappears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect austerity programs that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are becoming bl@@ iss@@ ful , our future is dark and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy business@@ men and corporations , which , however , are too frigh@@ tening to invest in , where it would be productive and income , with which one could wear the debt @-@ mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past three months , in the United States , in England and the euro@@ zone , 3.2 tril@@ lion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars sound after a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing but to infl@@ ate the stock prices and apply the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that would stimulate the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . &quot;
&quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances bring about that Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to fund especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy based on these exclusi@@ ons .
&quot; the decision of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voice @-@ weigh@@ ting in questions of state bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- was a democr@@ ati@@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place in which the economy gradually emig@@ rated and deprived them . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government today , and yet not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably feeds the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has chann@@ elled the policy so far as it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ induced economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality increases , the general economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must restore politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
&quot; the Marxist left had this idea already a hundred years ago , and it was not very good . &quot;
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must recon@@ struct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving humans and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; A@@ gor@@ a &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company , please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no differentiation between those belonging to the company but which do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds invest in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is also the Liber@@ al , in whom they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thanks again .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing this not , technological development will create such a massive drop in total economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , Marx is absolutely relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek one , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have clearly said what you hold from the point of view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now pre@@ di@@ cts to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive fault line was running through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be delayed for a while , but when the changes happen , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its constitution . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they did not want to deal with the faults that were going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we have lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , imposed on us by this policy , stated : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the free@@ ze@@ able cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to enter the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me it will also be retro@@ spec@@ tively to the future of the Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for joining TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy passed three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an icon hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website , and the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after you looked into a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium output , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t just enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon does so , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out of nothing for free , one attacks , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are watching at watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who will record everything .
&quot; you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and get the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they show the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to figure out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went to a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ vers@@ ed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because logic says that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you &apos;re making , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , then this is something start@@ ling because we live in a time where we have more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it are you in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results created . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of experienced firms are even wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they could predict due to data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year around year by year , until it suddenly did not work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these mistakes , data streams flow into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as deciding on a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision , how to take all these parts , put together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that didn &apos;t stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they were taking a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order to not forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the tool for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will test it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in hind@@ sight on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
