&quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps , which change your view of the city &quot;
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t chapel that is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers economies the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everybody knows , who had to upset himself because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a change road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ opoli@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; the large over@@ sight card has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and communities , so @-@ called primitive sheets . &quot;
&quot; according to the specifications of the Bavarian survey@@ ing process , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the Munich judgment sheet dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
the comparison of early and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the map , so 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser until 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ Recor@@ ding &quot; &quot; from which the corn@@ erst@@ one was derived . &quot;
small plots today no farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the October test , was in the 19th century in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the judgment sheet , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once closed humans with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ derer was created &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was associated with King Ludwig II &apos;s death . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ halle in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people in the Munich area of Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet . &quot;
the Order acquired the 1920 &apos;s building complex and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .
&quot; to the west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; - in an architectural style based on the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed around 18@@ 56 as &quot; main pl@@ aza , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bombs of the Al@@ lies cr@@ acked many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line took place . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen Rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to take special care when travelling by the state , as there are a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; it says in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more serious to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are put together or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney Office , where it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more often than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring it to a ch@@ ewing income or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FBI that classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws , committed local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on site .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisher@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U town association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first glimp@@ sed into his farm in which he managed to farm 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , fed 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste , only regional . &quot;
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profitable on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much need to be handled with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the farm and managed to run it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not carry out organic farming . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers should be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could still be with@@ drawn quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
&quot; because of the promotion , farmers are often critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of € 71 500 , half by leader was funded , one quarter was the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this means that the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and conc@@ ub@@ ines it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White , the best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Survey ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be tra@@ iled ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ ghing Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of hes@@ itation , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure equ@@ als 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate it as much as any other - hence the carefully directed overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have been fighting him if he had done it .
&quot; but it took its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s angry words , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ usive garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ osing waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller is not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the United States .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical representation .
&quot; Laz@@ arus changes this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh was hit here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Laz@@ arus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , smiling but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black joins Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ sman were part of the team of Great Britain
&quot; Director &apos;s Director of Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 starting on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; something special develops &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally included were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ ons , who are competing with their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the medium @-@ haul Mu@@ ir runs on this track and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dium . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics about Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the local voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long before the papers beat him because of everything , from the domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in the criticism , secure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and sil@@ ently , we are guided like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is ast@@ o@@ unding . &quot;
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the govern@@ ors &apos; side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ gans testi@@ fied A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ water @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people are taking a position on the same issue , they will be dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff described as &quot; concentrated Spam attack , &quot; would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic , or dropping a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ ti@@ cities and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but that is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable porn had a similar effect on the internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him on his lead . &quot;
and even back then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the Trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope home comforts for the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an has held the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led by Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels very special , &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t be able to defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it has gone so far .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance will belong to the six ball@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking space costs £ 5 per car with one occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attribut@@ able to passive smoking , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; the head of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there are lots of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is constantly imp@@ eded construction work , represents a major problem for the company &apos;s construction company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers before red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold land
&quot; if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ att@@ age in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a , &quot; directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen boy is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1.0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which arose for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea which included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrug@@ ated roofs , which have been converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no aliens . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has min@@ ed gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we commerci@@ alize Every@@ thing &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year contain , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week happens , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people fight to stop here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Papua , the M@@ om mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - its market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and violations in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their spot@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted , and beat the group with their gun @-@ guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ aires and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - constantly in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started to tow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; he told TIME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and looked for his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only we@@ ars a name , the TIME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him .
&quot; the Che@@ ap spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , commission@@ er P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ li@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings occurred only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , security minister Wir@@ anto said that he interfer@@ ed with an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said that he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if the UN was accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claiming more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody In@@ dependence Square in 1999 , 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fierce in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repe@@ ats the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers , who responded by firing warnings . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded arrived here quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the participating officers accoun@@ table and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of the Papua movement by increasing spor@@ adic attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
they rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses more competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation stops the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , international media coverage remains ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported to Mali due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific countries called T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically backed the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian State Department , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said to journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , they broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ oot , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims led to a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( Tor@@ ch Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the sh@@ outing of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) , and cooled the building . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cover , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : far@@ ther best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; during the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the two @-@ thirds majority supported for this sport , the Davis Cup single , was not supported by the two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ pack classic , the traditional competition is thus preserved . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal was not at all ready for the vote , to ex@@ tri@@ cate the finale at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training places , etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers will bring forbidden items into the aircraft , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously banned items by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while acci@@ dentally worn out knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they had late discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also stated that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents , who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent M@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X . &quot;
the most common items passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling goods have brought sm@@ ug@@ gling goods by the airport security , and how many were inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take along or how much of them .
so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA are prohibited fluids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
fluids are permitted on inland flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has previously under@@ estimated that part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less da@@ zz@@ ling number for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adver@@ tised over 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k is now clearing up : 6@@ 3,000 of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been re@@ trac@@ ed back . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far is about twelve percent of all orders to the problem . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested ways of production without greater load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , then the im@@ parti@@ ality of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent un@@ happy customers from exp@@ elling in pairs . &quot;

&quot; a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of the government environmental authorities to be more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Appe@@ al Court .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran for States on 1 October , in order to comply with the standards set for O@@ zone 2015 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to a year to study and avoid the plan , to interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was President of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regul@@ ations , which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the retirement regulatory agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Appe@@ al Court ruled in Washington that the EPA Administrator has passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its turn@@ around at O@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority we give ourselves seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive review of the o@@ zone rules .

tur@@ mo@@ il celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ bes will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town , the historical St. Hil@@ arius @-@ plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building on the ground have made friends and supporters tum@@ ul@@ tuous .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ary &apos;s chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische prim@@ eval @-@ book : &quot; &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to tum@@ ours with the bai@@ li@@ ff &quot; &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wor@@ ding of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron law belonged to and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible in the town picture of ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ler nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was derived from the early medieval owner law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest , continued to be the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; this ent@@ ails the right to use a priest , or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two zer@@ ni@@ est at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , windows were inserted and the bell wed@@ ges were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops were located near the church . &quot;
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ary Church collap@@ sed .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the steep@@ le and half crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off . &quot;
&quot; only the tower of the tower , still existing today , was preserved as a witness to the 750 year @-@ old church history . &quot;
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius @-@ system from the &quot; &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; &quot; as the success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organis@@ er , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery at the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , the organis@@ er places fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius press that is of importance for tum@@ ours and listeners .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the approval of wind@@ mills
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ anders &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned itself to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the club &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ anders &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining urban area . &quot;
&quot; such zones are meant to prevent &quot; &quot; as@@ parag@@ us &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a mold ble@@ mish . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been entered with the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter once more .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , which took part in the city of Vier@@ sen , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households . &quot;
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in a deadly way .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police figures , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the frame of the accompanying journey with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother passed the L 333 in direction to Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping centre in the city centre in September . &quot;
&quot; the trade association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to l@@ ure the citizens to the shopping m@@ umm@@ el in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chair@@ person of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend announced the customers to sensi@@ tise the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in preparation be commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; this means that the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ selling Sunday , with sales so@@ ff@@ ing Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include tourists and tourists .
but also many locals had lost sight of the city centre while shopping .
&quot; at the end everybody would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center , to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was applied to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread , had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Con@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen shared that the country &apos;s third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , participating in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the esteem of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her behaviour in a direct environment .
two deaths and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; at a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) , there was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when part of a school building crashed at the explosion .
a first mixed one was also found dead later .
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as an accident , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
there were only a few people in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy during the holiday period .
Tr@@ ump set up telep@@ hon@@ ed tran@@ scripts by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to inform publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compl@@ ained him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an intense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; was and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; &quot; de@@ pot &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massac@@ res : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ year Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and glan@@ cing through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it from the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; crying tears the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience has a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were las@@ hed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever indic@@ ted for the kill@@ ings .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia , and a lifetime citizen . &quot;
&quot; for him , the creation serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
a court officer places a bed sheet on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ f@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on a free walk for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time to vote against the black citizens of Georgia for the first time in summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said rum@@ ours were in the city , that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they were then removed from prison and approaching Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , expos@@ ing evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual release of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping , and is based in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that it does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for many years , but he said the role will never be simpler . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and presses it , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said that he , w@@ asting away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona escap@@ es the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; we@@ aving one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy moves in space , a sense of compan@@ ionship sub@@ stitutes the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a sad@@ ness , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children sit on their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wants to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done it for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience gets together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the post @-@ position with a black pair that they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words that left the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; she added , &quot; Today the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the follow @-@ up is in a way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging from a gigantic , six @-@ story background . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving platform ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter de@@ posed as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil drums remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which pul@@ ls itself through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ killer - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; K@@ ess seduc@@ ed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag@@ ged in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ ashed Siegfried .
&quot; later , even Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe it . &quot;
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , humili@@ ating and forming the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the light of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his director .
&quot; in 2013 , he had yet to have a rounded whist@@ le concert about himself , five years later , there was a great jubil@@ ation in which the scattered &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; it is noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunte@@ ering year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?

&quot; for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you are doing .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?

&quot; Pear@@ son cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business &quot;
&quot; the British Educational Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company faces . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , the General Director of John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , divided an Declaration of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement of NATO it is called the explosion on Thursday evening , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram aircraft .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 were about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is weak@@ ening the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has made a decision to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Policy 2015 , &quot; and said it show the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA Head Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature groups that are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
congreg@@ ate wants to share common areas
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two votes the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln resol@@ ves the establishment of a joint space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; it will still take place until the area of the church is in the communal possession until now , but there is no plan for planning a project that is being em@@ powered by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council are suspended , such a common room is not just a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by means of the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , thus , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to signal the investor , that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , stating that both the saddle and the ambient ceiling - which reduces the height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ ei , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
not that easy is the common room .
&quot; Daniela Ruf points to the many of his own buildings , with which one is not able to move in such a way , but now you rest in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks after a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy in any case of wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no grant , but a genuine , in case of doubt market@@ able counter value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; state &apos;s request to submit the proposal accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it remains with two votes in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller has sum@@ mar@@ ised : &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; as the police r@@ ushed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road to Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
one in the same direction driving passenger car driver gave him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously didn &apos;t think about the opposite . &quot;
he met with a car that was steering a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .

FC Bayern Munich has to ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with staff , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel services at the German Football @-@ Record Master Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ pa Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who was expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into its spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 people , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin of star walking to star
&quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; star nature trail &quot; is to emerge . &quot;
this is planned by the observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; deri@@ ves from the information needs of many resin visitors , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; well achiev@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in question came St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be supplemented by the Internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location choice . &quot;
accessibility is also a criteri@@ on .
&quot; later , the Star path should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in which con@@ stellation a selected star is given , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star value - the planet &apos;s path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail with its stel@@ ae leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Par@@ ish Equ@@ ens ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the plug@@ to @-@ planet degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun prot@@ ru@@ des exactly 70 centimet@@ res , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
&quot; Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ feather @-@ weight champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noticed that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; between the fighters . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I asc@@ ended to Bron@@ x &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
President Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight for a date in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , following their weight @-@ weight title fight in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he would like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he was thinking of the three combat champion from River@@ side , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could sense the momentum , which was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that must be done .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after a tyre placement
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first time , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connection point of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car drag@@ ged right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he was beaten and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about one hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed on to the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann , after 2 : 2 , hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the de@@ formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , if not the two opponents would have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to do better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be optimized further . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a free@@ wheel , the for@@ tun@@ ers don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be such that no one will stand beside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better after the experience in the preparation with the tri@@ ke than with the quad@@ ru@@ ple .
&quot; still , I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we &apos;re on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we do not make up so many bug@@ fixes . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the play of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland were an easy favorite on Sunday in the En@@ counter at last ( almost ) finished stadi@@ on of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we can swe@@ ep it , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s boss coach . &quot;
&quot; hitting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method to assess their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make more accurate assessment of age after the Swedish migration agency ( Migration Programme ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration @-@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said of the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases which suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results published , it stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road and Transport in the Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time at all three bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the other two bridges across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach stream .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
this is a border attachment which is also used as an operating path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,20 meters wide bridge cap should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian way is to go .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special t@@ act feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ writing about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ h@@ room in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher place entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ les is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties draw on a cord , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites to a poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , is the top duo for the parliamentary elections on 24 September , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D voters , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking space below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the president of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how is Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports about Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel . he tried for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ t there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D President Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be canc@@ eled shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can dism@@ iss - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ ach Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; hits a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is a sol@@ oist in the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach works with the two like in a new dress , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of Jazz ech@@ op@@ r@@ aut N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and the free play to a fascinating overall art work . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was premier@@ ed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled che@@ eses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of their &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally went apart bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette asser@@ ts against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was really in love with everyone I &apos;ve been in . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten has admitted that she is bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ aired .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; she suffered especially among them , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time when she liked to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to find yourself in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump once promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the Gover@@ nor of Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working for our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ NC Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot;
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics Director Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who were str@@ apped out of gold and silver medals at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the whole council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champ@@ ionships that will start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the director of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for the soldiers in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , some 1,000 people of the two soldiers have been thought of helicop@@ ters in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she called the two opposite pilots , however , as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their expert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before the highest sacrifice that they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Nord@@ hes@@ sen had come to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Manager of the German Armed Forces , Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives standing arms in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en described the other soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and s@@ atin . &quot;
the Stab@@ er@@ pillar was built up in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ achs , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , said , &quot; If this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed not the Minister of the Ley@@ en : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of high importance for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not give any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
he shared the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Dom@@ kirche of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a H@@ ehl end that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also took the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - neither after death , explained L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokes@@ person of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es in his nearly fifty @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk bow instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis rather than football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swi@@ ft re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
it was because of the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday .
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; member of the CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler , the Group wants to recommend its Group to include it . &quot;
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats together in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be re @-@ elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Mr Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to be able to further rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible his self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Land@@ tag of the Prime Minister withdraw@@ s confidence and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be scrut@@ in@@ ized legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally reasonable .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called T@@ sister &apos;s &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself as an app@@ endant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sliding dep@@ u@@ ties on the return of their land trade .
&quot; of course , we assume that they have returned their land @-@ trade fair , which they have received via the Green Country List , with immediate effect , &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even in the context of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Green Party members El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the social democr@@ at of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to re @-@ election the Parliament &apos;s day .
the ex@@ iting T@@ v@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in their final van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian places their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil , secretary general of the SPD @-@ General . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ating game and tries to make it political capital .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen combined with personal career as a result of the 2013 election . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens at that time , but in the country day , the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ler , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; in an interview with the German editorial network , Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) . &quot;
&quot; Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all that we currently know a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has ceased immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; the trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the sold products are bu@@ oy@@ ant and health@@ ily harmless . &quot;
&quot; if the resi@@ due level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , these are not bu@@ oy@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only on the staff or at the coher@@ ent jurisdiction ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made many times clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and bu@@ oy@@ ant food .
&quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ safe animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football will impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair@@ play rules created by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point , that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar has to sign and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be counter@@ acted with legitimate means of revenue which allow them the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter him from excessive expenditure . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely enhance the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the end @-@ end solution for the next five years will be worth EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fin@@ anc@@ ee of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of regular 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might attempt to cur@@ b their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies that are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will become amb@@ ass@@ adors and could easily find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot acquisitions . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s delay , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect financial Fair@@ play , because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new og@@ gi@@ an supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss Life . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the contract . &quot;
&quot; Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ and @-@ white chocolate tablets , which are 14 grams per year , distribute the flight att@@ endant before landing to the passengers . &quot;
&quot; at the cost , the Swiss did not want to report any information . &quot;
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants are in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to reveal . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is also nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the sket@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking box of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ ff@@ ing themselves to the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle aged play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody passes more after the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ th anniversary like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that sw@@ ings the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point cl@@ ashes a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ tically , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , in which Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well trained impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cr@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could inc@@ ur this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to view ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who bears a re@@ agent mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single one . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ eph continue to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything for food for a joke .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against Dru@@ gs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor was informed on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accus@@ ations were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials presented larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany . &quot;
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , temp@@ ted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been det@@ ained against the organized drug trade in the southern German area . &quot;
between the authorities in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning we were also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way lam@@ ented large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es in the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to large gaps in the foreign regi@@ sters register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data registered there could lead to &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; in cases of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis carried out by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the information , ten million people with foreign nation@@ als are recorded in the register , including some 5.7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by around 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; since the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 had been found in individual cases , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data input can significantly slow down processes , &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of tax@@ able people , EU citizens are also covered who don &apos;t have to travel . &quot;
&quot; these false assignments , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with out@@ going payments , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF performs such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant continues to move to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; the ministry is now saying : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these promises to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the female speaker of the Left Bank in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach people already provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now received 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Council of the Council , the municipality acknow@@ le@@ dges the willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is amazing how our body is created for it , and we give respect for the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are divided into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ tern were among the multiple @-@ giving and were awarded 50 contributions each . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter sold ten times per 500 milli@@ liter each of her life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that the economic growth &quot; &quot; jobs &quot; &quot; will remain , as they kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , whereas fewer members tended to increase in this month as weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in their quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , whereby inflation is likely to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be needed to bro@@ aden the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut Business Package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden the consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; a greater extent &quot; &quot; than the markets are expecting . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank however stressed that increases &quot; &quot; step @-@ by @-@ step &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it maintains its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound wor@@ shipped after these news to the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , since tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that the wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast can be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a part of lower consumption spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the sound . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last judgement on interest rates , the call for an interest rate rose as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has decreased from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be tigh@@ tened again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that over@@ writing in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent set@@ back of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive once more , as the len@@ ders want to speak lou@@ dly to businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those who run the existing deals and shut down the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with roy@@ alty free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis interventions taken before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ disposition pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicine this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
pre@@ p when targeted on need@@ y and vulnerable people provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
&quot; from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , president of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the termination of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced itself from a great house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; said Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architect and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked over each other , without having to bend down . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with much additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all the pieces and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter @-@ important so that when you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meter of slightly standard into something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis of one of the largest real estate imperi@@ alists in Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
it was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now encompasses offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that Col@@ in possesses property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved itself to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice occurred . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also struggle to control over the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but tos@@ ses Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hopes to settle the argument . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the case , with hundreds of sites with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held firm law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ charge of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to &quot; &quot; West@@ co &quot; &quot; when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to transmit her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in held back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; because the case is before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; he said , and he added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
m@@ umps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports , hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff at his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wanted to repair : bad information that fell into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
Kell@@ ys Diagnos@@ tic makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former election advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to control the Twitter habit , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that t@@ witter &apos;s t@@ witter habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; perhaps these campaign officials do not know anything , which we do not know other - that m@@ umps of twe@@ ets without their interventions had even more ignition . &quot;
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his co @-@ workers managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from provo@@ king Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - which deals with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction of the advis@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons to provide dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a vul@@ cano to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is sti@@ ff@@ ing to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff , K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of the chic@@ anes , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is to be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe kick@@ ed off in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards of dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the selected heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experience would have shown that many fle@@ eting could hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been seen . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online dating could have been arrested up to now , at least eleven of them based on references after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , which have negotiated an atro@@ city drawn by the community to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ ors . &quot;
travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull which is called the Milli@@ on@@ aire series .
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kick@@ ed out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ged by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be put into action by shame , as he was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal taxes , if the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just watched the last round of those travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for Soli@@ hull &apos;s Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible notify an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Birk@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
&quot; from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be located . &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the hotel Birk@@ enhof by the then Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH , on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 qualifying stays per year were lost and also proceeds through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , the number of refugees who arrived in the administrative district was offered the hotel building of the Coun@@ cill@@ or as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Council of Ministers .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , blan@@ kets partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer talking to our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large sho@@ ck@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty cosm@@ opol@@ itan &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the performances of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he counts . &quot;
&quot; the external plants are also brought to the front @-@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; there is a large terrace in a courtyard , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Issu@@ er sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special educ@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the committee received the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to persons entrusted to the cause . &quot;
the paper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully have interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller explores whether there were agreements between the m@@ umps of the campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , who acted in the election campaign as advis@@ ers of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more l@@ umps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump was personally drawn to the center and attempts to investigate whether the President might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys &apos;s main task is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called the &quot; &quot; Trial Cham@@ bers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in most cases , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N , pre @-@ charges have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement , it was called in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ umps Ad@@ vis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former election manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation . &quot;
&quot; the legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that if it should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the rise of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement , he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually work in walking , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a fair way .
&quot; the former FBI director , James Com@@ ey , said three times that he was not determined against the president . &quot;
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been appointed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ ash , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had grown lou@@ dly , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump had asked him about setting up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the off@@ erer and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent specialist in the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air , around the later revers@@ ed President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the Special Issu@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has loos@@ ened from the barely seven @-@ fold magnitude of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , which weighs heavily on a tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron gi@@ ants who have registered in the last three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ eberg is unclear according to research data .
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of c@@ ud@@ dly in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken @-@ out col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ r .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aciers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this ice @-@ file , the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen was broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , because the front edge has never gone back as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate stands under tension and can de@@ grade if at a key point a piece breaks off . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the gl@@ aciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only moder@@ ately , writes the British research project on the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen of Ant@@ arc@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the fur@@ th@@ est retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not re@@ trace the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , many ice @-@ c@@ ud@@ dle of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades . &quot;
this long zip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends to South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decrease in temperature increased .
&quot; in the last 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been around three degrees warmer and counting towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ stag has entered 41 new positions in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in circles are obviously very much sought after .
around 620 applications have been available for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle lacks further personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places in M@@ ett@@ mann &apos;s circle . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the strengths of the general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to step up the initiative and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; after the request of the parties , the administration shall develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application of candidates . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems which one did not know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees come from the service of disease or age . &quot;
&quot; the highest time to act therefore , so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , president of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long been making a bad surprise already in the Krei@@ stag , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and b@@ aff@@ led the rest of the parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which permit a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U is trying to pay better the employees and officials than the tari@@ ff for the public service is actually fores@@ een . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when switching to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and county director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO &apos;s rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with men &apos;s dealers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself in detail of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in a statement to the social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew take infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by men &apos;s traders , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting happened allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;
&quot; for this , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there have always been leng@@ th@@ ier li@@ festy@@ les for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , there was a viewpoint at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ wered &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ comes brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at@@ mos@@ pher@@ es inhal@@ ed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 miles and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga stands for e @-@ sport
&quot; do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather via the stadium racing ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees . &quot;
these have also recognized the first federal lig@@ aments that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain that there are still several clubs on that train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Federation organis@@ es FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where Gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified for example . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asi@@ atic ones . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in E @-@ Sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just football @-@ simulation FIFA are challenged at the level of competition . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ itzer has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding , and a quick responsi@@ veness . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console , but also exercise their body and watch the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itt@@ est player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , the rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the go international , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the consulting company Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive entertaining software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts the E @-@ Sport ahead of rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
sales are expected to be 130 million in three years .
&quot; this is not enough for the Bundes@@ liga , which is just under 2.4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
internationally many countries are already ahead .
&quot; large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ cr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching unit , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ premi@@ er league associations , according to Dut@@ t , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , it is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to keep the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
you can &apos;t stick to that only when football remains as it always was .

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy are pushing for suicide , &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was convic@@ ted in June for neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unpleasant .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; it was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have changed Conrad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a terrible circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ t@@ ted .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I walk with everything . I try , despite all my pain , that we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , stab yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered them to benefit from any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Carter belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted for murder at her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not a prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ Me : learning from the new mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup as captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not har@@ ming there .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ ba immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told after his first use as a Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the deposit could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach could also interpret it in such a way .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen to be chosen by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants , and just out of the holidays called C @-@ El@@ f as a player , but he . &quot;
sugar is distributed as much as possible to those you want to keep in a good mood .
&quot; those who were chosen to compete with L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed as mini @-@ l@@ ame on the field .
&quot; right back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me worked like the one who can best take the helm . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , trying to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal therefore , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it to establish on Teufel come out to the performances of the Asia trip ( also only partially ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le had no negative effect on her first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot . &quot;
this worked very well .
&quot; besides Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y ran off against the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to successfully compete for a couple of times in the building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also brought up . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw after the game . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me adopted a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I &apos;ve noticed now . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often im@@ plac@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies in the region speak to T V @-@ enquiry of a change in economic policy - and at the same time ad@@ orn the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; the biggest down@@ turn is nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au , is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list . &quot;
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 should be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ eration of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ ways Plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as is stimul@@ ated by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master Bonus the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1,000 euros is provided for the Master &apos;s exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of their master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction will provide fast facts , at the same time l@@ acked the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , who wants to hire bis@@ sing at state @-@ run mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied until now . &quot;
the I@@ HK requested more orders to be placed on external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U Group vice Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calcul@@ ating the calcul@@ ator , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of regional roads as proposed . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared the field after four months of ir@@ regul@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described things as call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases , also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of sub@@ mitting the powerful auto@@ ch@@ men and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called waste @-@ old devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several employees were accused of Volkswagen in the United States , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after having accused the authorities of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .

porn @-@ Movie with T@@ ight@@ T@@ ini
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the buttons of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh , because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed , among other things , as a carto@@ on@@ ist for congrat@@ ulation @-@ cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he succeeded in the late six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artists of cities were inspired . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting on the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches continue to find its dro@@ ple@@ y pieces worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series for six years with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack @-@ foot@@ er as a counterpart .
&quot; for the first time , his figures appear in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened with climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and due to diseases that transmit diseases , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , large head@@ aches are prepared . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the impact of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has implications for the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small chic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ goats , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for holiday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; &quot; instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat to Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : enemies , Neut@@ r@@ ale , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement from violence , and while in the whole country the bodies are frequent , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been under federal protection in December 2012 , and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smile face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consistent and although the terrain is now tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little us@@ efulness , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we distr@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility &apos; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez had been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling cartridge fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you fall as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead men ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ e @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could flu@@ ke like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Is His love for the routine to be a cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and landing ways to get drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells false , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ e Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the space where the employees from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before was known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy of the governor himself . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has ble@@ w up to three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expenditure that concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
&quot; there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
only a few months earlier readers had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been converted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; in organized protests and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and ref@@ using them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since requested that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
the media group &quot; Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; last year attracted more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as card : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones lay beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that the drug trade is frigh@@ tened him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ mar@@ ise . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ alen and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the boarding gate , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ s near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the tra@@ inees asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that its fl@@ aky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the hard@@ est ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just b@@ link a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bled a pil@@ ing tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique , which is known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to be better in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ady , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ aded sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by eating din@@ osau@@ rs by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady sh@@ aded - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors have to have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s skin was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ serving dar@@ ling to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with a preserved skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost the same today as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just ch@@ ase a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous time was a time when huge sp@@ her@@ os , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who were standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sunk after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that rag@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was sw@@ ung by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the door@@ step still covers b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , and his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , around 5 p.m. between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , some 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , crashed . &quot;
&quot; at first , there were no indications of the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was mild to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of the direction of Munich , a total of approximately ten kilometres of long back traffic was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive han@@ di@@ caps - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade noted the hall@@ mark of the car drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
German rail@@ ways : group test &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing seems to sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an impro@@ per or sn@@ aps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
passport control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn ( Deutsche Bahn ) is currently testing the running ticket inspec@@ tions .
it is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes to , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available early next year on many further distance routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor .
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like that : one goes into the train , calling his ticket at &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat y .
&quot; when the driver comes to the Y card control card , he knows that there is a passenger with an already discounted online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train companion , check out the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the Marketing Executive Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often drive train knows that besides delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often one has , in any case , not all the documents necessary for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companion and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and at the end time takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after arriving in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she switched off her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said to her statement . &quot;
this is not the sort of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that consists of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked , which she had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of ... what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally experienced no ec@@ lec@@ tic racism , she is no different than the next black female child . &quot;
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the Police Office , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined together with a local business@@ man who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s figure .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came into the mind of Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his engagement gave Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other locals the team was followed by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she falls in love and marri@@ es her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , laugh@@ ing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Matter &quot; in social media after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions than a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news @-@ cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels oblig@@ ated to this memory , since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into supporters and ad@@ vers@@ aries since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the topic .
&quot; on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while they say a bit @-@ gallery , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates are building a gallery attracting more customers into the city , including the rest of the shops , the ad@@ vers@@ aries fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will end . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying a week in the farmers market hall . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the conc@@ ub@@ ines always happy . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this is likely not to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why buy shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some have been there for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at low cost . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , store stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , as the local r@@ ents are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not suit Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmer &apos;s market hall be in the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the ghost bit gallery before selling all the shops out of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not place any more . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable res@@ emb@@ lance : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ pieces sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st established a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly disclosed diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable res@@ emb@@ lance ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline reconc@@ iled her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could look from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone could be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ rolling and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Chel@@ seas Jud@@ gment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths , in order to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a written artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her excessive signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written by a thousand @-@ foot@@ er of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the artist &apos;s highly developed scientific dictionary ) , how amazing , at least in biological respect , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ ree Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a free speech ef@@ oot in the hands of the United States disciplinary groups like King Kong .
&quot; when they col@@ oni@@ ze your speech , then they have won . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations , which conver@@ ge like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea as the movement , which was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
&quot; Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford , for murder &quot;
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warrant were issued on account of murder of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Local Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago was that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of the event , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively search for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology since 2007 at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them are now in risk and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair , investigated by the relevant authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
security cameras have been confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to meet the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ initi@@ ation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing checks in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell any eggs anymore
they shared the company groups .
&quot; it was a matter of precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was reported in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice products . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency in its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people out of the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to implement surveys , speci@@ als groups and demographic groups , and in some cases allow whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to deal with the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
she said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low cons@@ ular results - so that you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that has been punished for an environment of anno@@ y@@ ances , for those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sectors could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Financial Technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ t , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; recently , u@@ ber has registered as a client . &quot;
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting businesses can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows the employee to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion sei@@ zes regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that deals poor@@ ly with its employees or beha@@ ves in@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Conver@@ t for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the dis@@ comfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses converting , problems which were previously identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ - faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; converting received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire V@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , thus raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is listening to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t used . &quot;
investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the manager of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than 4,000 questions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask , &quot; &quot; Do you really belong to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly staff surveys , has been able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the company keeps getting new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot @-@ parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t mill , &quot; said Bru@@ en @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood were carrying out practical exercises .
they should keep 18 exercises over the course of August 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the general amend@@ ment of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the player &apos;s busy itiner@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pack on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will termin@@ ate its practices once the camp is over , what is given by the clear guidelines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been kick@@ ed off with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ post , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t care too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results under the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false reports and send them to factor inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points of stake for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks as they do not manage to quickly eliminate h@@ water @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the insight , which stories of fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test its feature of the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ er . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he felt un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell as smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is also present . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &apos; ) to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hybrid heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with fellow country@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started taking care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed : &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go down ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ght@@ Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the insurrection began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good beginning .
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the Castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rol that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented by the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a fid@@ dler , always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ locked . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a San@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must finish with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ elle chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 301 year old Mari@@ elle chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; asked the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think of this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday shared website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive ple@@ dge , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; after all , they stand in competition with other communities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honne@@ f is a central five @-@ digit amount that will cost their new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is how this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the seat of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five vice @-@ ministers and the ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of people . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wi@@ re@@ actor of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; for 48@@ 6 persons who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , this week will be negotiated in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the attempt to overthrow the &quot; God gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really has the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abo@@ lition of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale guards at the army and the security forces continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan left another 73@@ 95 prosec@@ utor by decree , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they called on their role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ ization of the forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , NATO could not leave Nato too cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will be issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who will speak English who will have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for road@@ maps
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the rac@@ et@@ rack has been fought - now it is supposed to go quite quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the mar@@ ten road on which the tourist tram is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the rac@@ et@@ rack in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the circuit this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and refurb@@ ish the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; explained traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route resulted in about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , will be fin@@ alized at the moment , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already agreed on technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of 11 years .
&quot; as a result , the Rac@@ eway @-@ Shuttle will be scheduled to be ordered on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the past months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
&quot; just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver every amount of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ties have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and choose anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
but it becomes even more troub@@ ling as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ties have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , Real@@ Hel@@ ix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed celeb@@ ri@@ ties such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usion to rape if you go a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to somewhat dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men naturally do not stick to sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive about the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed body and the out@@ cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical res@@ emb@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
m@@ umps of great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a stap@@ le of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the U.S. voters , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot;
we all pret@@ end to burst into our filter bags .
&quot; less noticed was the power of m@@ umps , families to bring together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody knows , including the repub@@ lican kin@@ ship with which she strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely at the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dism@@ iss@@ al effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot;
&quot; there is however an even terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of mad@@ ness - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the them@@ ed pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magic experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during this week , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral change , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by throwing her through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim can be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a curious egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from the F@@ oods and the E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle stretched out its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat who wore the cylinders to the bet .
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
&quot; she wished every four @-@ person , that he feels accepted in his new school . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who repeatedly ski@@ ps in teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching they leave their students very reluc@@ t@@ antly , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ach@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight original äss@@ ler are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained because of illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , refer@@ enced by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , among them the Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Foreign Ministry reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
the controls will be continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of some 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no . the software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting arranged the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet an exact date . &quot;
Daimler announced to write every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fitting be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this hangs from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE tells you to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price deteri@@ oration of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; in the rural area , there is now no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE tells us to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first rap@@ pers one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the scholars . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award along with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the prize winner , which has been announced with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that it will take part in the gala event . &quot;
&quot; in the New York Times , he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and it bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear her view . &quot;
&quot; Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister joins R@@ ente next year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker City Buil@@ der has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press room .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it &apos;s surprising that so far no application can fulfill the requirement profile . &quot;
&quot; for the next possible time , the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer . &quot;
&quot; in this way , under consideration of the regular periods of dism@@ iss@@ al , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as a sub @-@ civil law authority , the applicant must demonstrate appropriate conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and it itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure about the building and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are various projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area are about to be found .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be@@ ech some 1.5 million euros , &quot; If we make it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
creative is present for a town@@ ship master of large play @-@ room .
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ achs &apos;s own yard and garden , it is possible to react quite flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned in a comm@@ end@@ able way by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is fitting &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the departure city builder . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master is carrying high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with support and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor will stay long , W@@ acker wishes himself : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate but also for the further design of the city .
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed study in Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , building guidance , barbecue facilities , management of municipal property , municipal property with building yard and urban gar@@ den@@ ers , as well as under construction law authority , including monuments protection . &quot;
bike thrown onto lines : South rail@@ road closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway slide over the Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them for the night hours .
&quot; near the Tat@@ ort , witnesses saw a red @-@ red rolling and a bike rider . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ b kingdom , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the transport of trains .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail replacement transport , potential of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ rail line could be led without han@@ di@@ caps . &quot;
&quot; almost ten personalities were dropped on Friday morning , two of them considered the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , affecting the USA approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , loss of weight and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while the suffer@@ ers usually get advised to steer meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells can pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food cannot enter the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far into the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance fo@@ stering immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el movements , if the same system also works in people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , was not . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enc@@ ers and found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they l@@ acked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria eman@@ ate from the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as well as mice , but defects in genes associated with tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound of signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ends against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people mar@@ ched like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho de@@ formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three additional commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have put great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; so the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new grav@@ estone for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; how the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only a fire from the party centre , but no counter@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House continuously monitor the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter @-@ wind . &quot;
there were failures .
and one after another .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can hardly be reli@@ eved , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising faction @-@ leaving of a Green Party dep@@ ended on the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German business@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the apo@@ sto@@ lic Dutch Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately give her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election manager of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true at all , &quot; &quot; said an election fighter , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ t reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition from the green dep@@ u@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the com@@ rade of his time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that was the case - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to tum@@ bling , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te s@@ wore the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , comrades , the comrades decided to re @-@ apply . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just fired up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him came the next descent .
&quot; mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus during the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he was doing so pretty much everything that could be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ogen@@ ous survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , because they agreed to stabil@@ ise the party by Wei@@ l . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty on the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and he doesn &apos;t even know Schulz .
&quot; at times , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , such as Ms. T@@ westen appointed her own career in career on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs T@@ westen was not elected because of her person as direct candidate , but by the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Lower Saxony MP continued . &quot;
the logical consequence is that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; consent four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he demanded to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding Award for Local Govern@@ ors III
anyone wishing to renov@@ ate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 there are sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; on 4 April , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ covering territory III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment area ?
&quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue , investigate where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the regional borders could also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EG spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be obj@@ ectively targeted , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; since January 1 , 2017 , the permit period for the funding is still ongoing until 30 April 2026 . &quot;
&quot; until September of this year , however , the continu@@ ance would first be carried out , as part of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order should be made as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year . &quot;
&quot; after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each Commun@@ e must carry out the predicted Vor@@ ab investigations . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to assess and decide the urban disp@@ arities , when it is rehabil@@ itated and in what extent . &quot;
&quot; for the respective property , there will also be a san@@ itation note in the basic book . &quot;
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to his feelings and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; , &quot; with which it is among other things about the structural state and the renovation . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; data can be made to size , division , and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operational bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled in , if premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new building measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of the funds according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; were presented to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first one in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ way , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Law@@ n for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the particulars of the military , which were left to the TIME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was issued alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Law@@ n , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the assistant naval commander for aviation . &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter hit the South Law@@ n on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and stayed for so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team for the return flight would be required .
&quot; the original air@@ liner was during the event at the helicopter , while the security guards of the unit stayed on the floor during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
the records provided by the TIME did not make clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you were shut up , &quot; replied the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president announced an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to ins@@ ulate government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation when the presidential jet led against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services and his Twitter account is full of reports that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the assistant secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws are frequent training flights in the area around Washington and South Law@@ n to en@@ force U.S. President at the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted in the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , a civil servant said . &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units additionally flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Law@@ n .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on them . &quot;
&quot; and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump addressed representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
&quot; at the forefront of the second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga , the championship k@@ icks off at Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV . &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the runner @-@ up of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite the five games still spot@@ less , the leading edge of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga got the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays a similar formation .
&quot; on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , mainly imports from the high north are concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be difficult for us as always .
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck , too . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; if you are not currently playing the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , the un@@ defeated ch@@ ill Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was playing with the White @-@ rus@@ set An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot;
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ amp , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team again . &quot;

how America can harm OM@@ V
&quot; actually , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; in his rush to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the U.S. advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages to pun@@ ish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , domestic OM@@ V investors , together with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region North Stream 2 . &quot;
the threatening is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to raise the sanctions by an Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; looked at which the Group could wi@@ den and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the newest bu@@ cks of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a For@@ tune 500 company , &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

roll back : the city employs 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day @-@ to @-@ day centres , the clock is revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the provision of food to the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city runs 46 day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for at least 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 participants from 1 September have kitchen service : they warm up the local dishes , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , propor@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ rank facilities - decides on the scope of the hour .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now firmly on the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ sheim . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
children should help prepare meals .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the ch@@ icks - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm , which it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong in education at around 750 people in education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , the official leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will channel at the Council &apos;s elections in the provinces . three women en@@ code for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
the elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be transferred peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ man said , &quot; &quot; a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

two young men at the age of 19 and 23 should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to information of the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who kept up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 pm because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the ma@@ iden &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed . &quot;

the two young men were subsequently arrested by the police .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; in the case of managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a trade union wants to verify the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work at work , which alongside other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; be first learned &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the business leader of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to &quot; &quot; express concerns that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the metropol@@ itan area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we regularly check our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
La Liga site may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be ref@@ unded in its pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar after issuing an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the World record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to the outside , although a source close to the Catalan state is that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to go down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter turned and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately turned into a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 , and so on the covering of the vehicle property damage of more than 200 euros was executed . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
&quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he was driving a car on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the tail lights . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au to the direction of Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
&quot; in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car had to meet him on his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver touched the tail lights . &quot;
property damage was made in the car .
&quot; the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it may well be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ fahrer hasn &apos;t noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the for@@ f@@ eit , as well as the driver of the user experience , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he was waiting for the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret concerning their own om@@ issions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; was measured . &quot;
&quot; in view of the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which must be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; so the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as source of all evil is already part of everyday experience , preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also commented on Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a bon@@ ed fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; strikes have been a quite normal educational tool &quot; , &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the reminder book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is presented in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber presented ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of over gri@@ ps , 67 dome @-@ cats sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion , the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accus@@ ations , many victims appreciate the general Hum@@ anity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence from violence to shel@@ ters at shel@@ ters &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became handy when a dome set musi@@ cally does not have a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all . &quot;
&quot; to him , eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
also the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him at best , to know of it too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents - so literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also present a very excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by children &quot; grapes . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains of its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high level of emotion@@ ality , which also led to bru@@ te erup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t just kne@@ ad on the ground with chairs and threw the key@@ boards on the ground , but also gave ear @-@ fei@@ gn@@ ed and too che@@ ek@@ y boys to the hair or ears , he has already admitted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state secondary school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly dig@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one wonders if it is not more familiar with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many people who never understood him are still eager . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , there was a great deal of abuse on the topic of abuse at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also have some involvement or complic@@ ity in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the dome master .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said a sad@@ dened representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in En@@ ligh@@ tenment was sexual abuse and yet is that most victims of shame remain silent .
&quot; if they did not even confi@@ de to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who had been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : an inqu@@ iring student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case where he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was calculated ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ent or clearer , or even sooner rather than vis @-@ à @-@ vis their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust@@ ees , etc . &quot;
that talking to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , George R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to an ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was read by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former &quot; &quot; Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of taking a &quot; &quot; look &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in reporting everything has become a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; in fact , there is clearly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and , we say , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from time since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were shu@@ ff@@ led and mal@@ igned and suffered , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; Prim@@ ary School &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimated the overall humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked at . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again by 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time , as a legal clarity , as testing pen@@ alties were long banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows yet . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of ass@@ essing the past according to modern moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was used in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent chil@@ dr@@ ens , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally worked up .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear@@ fig@@ s and hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then prohibited , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of testing as well as the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not deny that there was a stric@@ test reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could even do something wrong with a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly contact him , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today to enrich their lives and bring them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to whom they still look at today and which they are almost hon@@ our@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to it are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at for the sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably knows no one to know the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
