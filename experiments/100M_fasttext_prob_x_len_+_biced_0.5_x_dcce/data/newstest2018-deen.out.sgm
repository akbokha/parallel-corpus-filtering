<seg id="1">"Munich 1856: four maps, which change your view of the city"</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners economies the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows, who had to upset himself because the car-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a change road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geopoliortals Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering carpet that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large oversight card has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and communities, so-called primitive sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the specifications of the Bavarian surveying process, these were created between 1810 and 1864, and from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Munich judgment sheet dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the map, so 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbers from the so-called" "UrRecording" "from which the cornerstone was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots today no farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the October test, was in the 19th century in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "on the Gasteig" "or" "On the air" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once closed humans with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich District-Irrenderer was created" On the Auer Lüften "." "</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - the psychiatrist who was associated with King Ludwig II's death."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenhalle in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people in the Munich area of Salesianum meet."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920's building complex and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west is the football field of the TSV Munich Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in an architectural style based on the original building of the Irrenaissance, was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as" main plaza, "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufingerstrasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the bombs of the Allies cracked many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line took place."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farming has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state Missouri, which is to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when travelling by the state, as there are a number of questionable, racist-based incidents in the whole state and be noted here," it says in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people more serious to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who are disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are put together or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Missouri Attorney Office, where it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more often than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring it to a chewing income or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FBI that classifies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws, committed local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisherman's CDU town association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first glimpsed into his farm in which he managed to farm 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, fed 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"on the table of the Feriengäste, only regional."</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the fence project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitable on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much need to be handled with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the farm and managed to run it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not carry out organic farming."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers should be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could still be withdrawn quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">"because of the promotion, farmers are often criticised."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of €71 500, half by leader was funded, one quarter was the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"this means that the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and concubines it doesn't."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White, the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Survey (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be trailed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman's Weighing Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of hesitation, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of disclosure equals 35 hectares, the calculated costs are over 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate it as much as any other - hence the carefully directed overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have been fighting him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it took its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's angry words, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your idleness, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the elusive garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elosing waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changes this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame to the world around:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh was hit here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, smiling but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not to enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black joins Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsman were part of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"Director's Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland" "something special develops" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"your captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally included were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medallions, who are competing with their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-haul Muir runs on this track and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics about Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the local voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long before the papers beat him because of everything, from the domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in the criticism, secure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and silently, we are guided like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is astounding."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haired head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governors' side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogans testified Amelia Chasse the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hwater-filled people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with water, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't like this idea, if a number of people are taking a position on the same issue, they will be disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's staff described as" concentrated Spam attack, "would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic, or dropping a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corticities and to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable porn had a similar effect on the internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him on his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the Trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting this.</seg>

<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery-area in Tumbes will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historical St. Hilarius-plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building on the ground have made friends and supporters tumultuous.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 St. Hilary's chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische primeval-book:" "Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to tumours with the bailiff" "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the certificate, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron law belonged to and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which is still visible in the town picture of ours, the" mountain "of the third, the magnificent settler nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was derived from the early medieval owner law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest, continued to be the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"this entails the right to use a priest, or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two zerniest at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), windows were inserted and the bell wedges were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops were located near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm broke the steeple and half crashed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off."</seg>
<seg id="492">"only the tower of the tower, still existing today, was preserved as a witness to the 750 year-old church history."</seg>

<seg id="496">Local Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not bother Neymars Weltrekord transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fairplay rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point, that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make the money loose, so that Neymar has to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power-rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be counteracted with legitimate means of revenue which allow them the break-even point in their activities related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich, originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter him from excessive expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely enhance the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the end-end solution for the next five years will be worth EUR 44.4 million in the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a financee of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of regular 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that might attempt to curb their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies that are linked to the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>

<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, whereas fewer members tended to increase in this month as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>

<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, since the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden the consumption. "</seg>

<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylaxis interventions taken before sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>

<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as" important new intervention, "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Predisposition prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV-status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt-in to participate in their local sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicine this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep when targeted on needy and vulnerable people provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are infected with HIV, and that they will contribute to the termination of the dissemination of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designers tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced itself from a great house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," "said Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other, without having to bend down."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height, with much additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the pieces and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counter-important so that when you push the door, it is very easy to slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>

<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now encompasses offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as" "main operator and the dominating personality" "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Mumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports, hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff at his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to repair: bad information that fell into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnostic makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," said the former election advisor Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to control the Twitter habit, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that twitter's twitter habit was ever" under control, "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"perhaps these campaign officials do not know anything, which we do not know other - that mumps of tweets without their interventions had even more ignition."</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his co-workers managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from provoking Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - which deals with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisors, the president for strategic reasons to provide doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump can react like a vulcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is stiffing to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh," being the source behind a heap of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of the chicanes, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoke it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">"from the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise will be located."</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH, on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 qualifying stays per year were lost and also proceeds through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, the number of refugees who arrived in the administrative district was offered the hotel building of the Councillor as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Council of Ministers.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>

<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still a lot to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer talking to our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large shockable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty cosmopolitan" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>

<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale inner city level, Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: U.S. Special Issuer sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special educator Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the committee received the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to persons entrusted to the cause."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper presented the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully have intervened in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller explores whether there were agreements between the mumps of the campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, who acted in the election campaign as advisers of the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more lumps of private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump was personally drawn to the center and attempts to investigate whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">Grand Jurys's main task is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called the" "Trial Chambers". ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the transmitter CNN, pre-charges have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were summoned to a statement, it was called in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr. were also Trumps Advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former election manager Paul Manafort in conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"the legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if it should be necessary to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the rise of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russian history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb declared in a statement, he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also usually work in walking, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a fair way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI director, James Comey, said three times that he was not determined against the president."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been appointed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rash, accusations against Trump had grown loudly, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump had asked him about setting up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the offerer and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent specialist in the Congress, such as the Watergate Affair, around the later reversed President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, after which the Special Issuer could no longer be dismissed as easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has loosened from the barely seven-fold magnitude of Berlin from the Schelfeisen."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, which weighs heavily on a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest iron giants who have registered in the last three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual interruptions of cuddly in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken-out colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeir.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeisen is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this ice-file, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeisen was broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never gone back as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate stands under tension and can degrade if at a key point a piece breaks off."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only moderately, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI-data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelfeisen is the fourth biggest Schelfeisen of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the furthest retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collapsing, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not retrace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many ice-cuddle of the Antarctic peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long zip of Antarctica extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decrease in temperature increased.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been around three degrees warmer and counting towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1551">"because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant jobs, the CDU calls out of the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the Kreistag has entered 41 new positions in the administration."</seg>

<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in circles are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications have been available for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle lacks further personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 non-occupied places in Mettmann's circle."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as the strengths of the general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to step up the initiative and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"after the request of the parties, the administration shall develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application of candidates."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, showing concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems which one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees come from the service of disease or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"the highest time to act therefore, so that no more jobs remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, president of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long been making a bad surprise already in the Kreistag, when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and baffled the rest of the parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be checked, which permit a withdrawal from the communal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-related towns - should strive for a" "Haustarif", "so people."</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone of NGO's rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with men's dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself in detail of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement to the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew take inflatable migrants on board, which can be delivered directly by men's traders, and that the smugglers can shut down so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting happened allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobitzer has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding, and a quick responsiveness."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also exercise their body and watch the diet."</seg>

<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but that day, in the shade of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: enemies, Neutrale, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings suffice."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to stand on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement from violence, and while in the whole country the bodies are frequent, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been under federal protection in December 2012, and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsistent and although the terrain is now treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little usefulness, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility 'if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez had been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling cartridge factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have angered the sons, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenues."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you fall as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead men... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoe-Team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could fluke like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Is His love for the routine to be a calamity?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and landing ways to get drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells false, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoe Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the employees from Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trustworthy of the governor himself."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has blew up to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditure that concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier readers had seen Valdez's column as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been converted to storage space for signs and stickers, which protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Micoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing" SOS Press "in organized protests and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and refusing them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since requested that she is re-divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" last year attracted more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas card:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the front page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is frightened him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to summarise."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with Bandenrivalen and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the boarding gate, they released the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren heuls near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were ready.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," "said Bojorquez," "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the trainees asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the hardest armored dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved condition has astonished researchers, who describe it as" "really remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resembled a piling tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a parachuting technique, which is known as a counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to be better in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shady, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shaded shaded is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur was chased by eating dinosaurs by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the shady shaded - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been the Cretaceous period," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his conserving darling to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with a preserved skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost the same today as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just chase a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous time was a time when huge spheros, carnivorous dinosaurs, who were standing on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that ragged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured herbivorous was swung by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the doorstep still covers bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot lies on his side, and his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="2021">"only one day after arriving in New York City, sitting in St. Louis, sitting on the bed of an airbnb flat she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year old child, and it is still on the road," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the area of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She switched off her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be his father's father, who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his rifle and cried," "I will kill you... animals all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "Ferrell said to her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the sort of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she picked up her 6-year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a cauliflower and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked, which she had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson now, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only to know activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally experienced no eclectic racism, she is no different than the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the Police Office, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined together with a local businessman who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has totally changed after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr just wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into the mind of Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement gave Ferrell the project closer, along with six other locals the team was followed by" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that in this work and in the humanization of black people there must be a certain vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, who have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell has been chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions than a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news-cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a chant and she feels obligated to this memory, since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and adversaries since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while they say a bit-gallery," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man needs "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates are building a gallery attracting more customers into the city, including the rest of the shops, the adversaries fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Zimmer:" "for many years we have been buying a week in the farmers market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the concubines always happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely not to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why buy shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops here are empty - some have been there for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at low cost."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, store stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms, as the local rents are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not suit Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmer's market hall be in the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery before selling all the shops out of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's simply not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg do not place any more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hairpieces sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst established a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly disclosed diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks's website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline reconciled her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could look from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone could be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette strolling and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would convert Chelseas Judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually only few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths, in order to inflame the rigid divisions which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a written artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her excessive signature among them (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written by a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific dictionary), how amazing, at least in biological respect, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spree Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she appears with a free speech efoot in the hands of the United States disciplinary groups like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they colonize your speech, then they have won." "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter she wrote to me," "the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which converge like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea as the movement, which was also hiding behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">"Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford, for murder"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, looking for suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrant were issued on account of murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Local Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago was that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology since 2007 at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem are now in risk and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair, investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University collaborates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman for the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investigators in any conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged suspects to submit to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities will help find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras have been confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the world-anti-doping agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," "said Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to meet the code that describes the criteria for re-initiation of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything will be implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on state-sponsored doping in Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales outlet rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "Smirnov added."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping checks in Russia in the course of the doping scandal."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low consular results - so that you can reboot why."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-er."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014" Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, "a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he felt unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter, which was written by a double-agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver every amount of it and we will see them much more frequently," "Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexputies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and choose anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more troubling as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexputies have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, RealHelix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed celebrities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusion to rape if you go a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" "it is said on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and their increasing sophistication point to somewhat darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men naturally do not stick to sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain tentatively on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaks out of the boundary zones can be very instructive about the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising to have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total subjugation."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps of great performance?</seg>

<seg id="2426">"it has become a staple of the Trump era that the political divisions, which have polarized the U.S. voters, also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all pretend to burst into our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed was the power of mumps, families to bring together."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everybody knows, including the republican kinship with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strangely at the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the dismissal effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer meet us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is however an even terrifying long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing" normalizes, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of madness - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild offence."</seg>

<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it's surprising that so far no application can fulfill the requirement profile."</seg>

<seg id="2542">"in this way, under consideration of the regular periods of dismissal, there is still enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administration community as a sub-civil law authority, the applicant must demonstrate appropriate conclusions."</seg>

<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill it any more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>

<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs's own yard and garden, it is possible to react quite flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned in a commendable way by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what is fitting "when new buildings are approved, emphasises the departure city builder."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, affecting the USA approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the sufferers usually get advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells can patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food cannot enter the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far into the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance fostering immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movements, if the same system also works in people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, was not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice were sequenced DNA sequencers and found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria emanate from the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol 3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan had halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as well as mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2631">"this once again shows more: red-green can hardly be relieved," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber on the editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising faction-leaving of a Green Party depended on the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green-German businessman Michael Kellner has called on the apostolic Dutch Green-member Elke Twesten to give back their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there are sensitivities.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the allowance was still at 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on 4 April, the government presidium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a recovering territory III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are from the country, the rest of the community sensitivities."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a refurbishment area?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will, as Schindler continue, investigate where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the regional borders could also shift again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the STEG spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme" Social City, "where the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is revitalization of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be objectively targeted, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"since January 1, 2017, the permit period for the funding is still ongoing until 30 April 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September of this year, however, the continuance would first be carried out, as part of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the order should be made as soon as possible, so that the renovations can begin next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"after that, Pietzschmann declared that each Commune must carry out the predicted Vorab investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the aim is to assess and decide the urban disparities, when it is rehabilitated and in what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective property, there will also be a sanitation note in the basic book."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"once again, Pietzschmann will come back to his feelings and get a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"Gotzel emphasised, an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arc", "with which it is among other things about the structural state and the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" household and housing arch, "data can be made to size, division, and residents of a living room."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "operational bow" "is only to be filled in, if premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, to be noted, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new building measures are not conducive."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds according to the" "greyhound principle" "- who first comes, grinds first."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"you can't reserve funds for later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2706">"finally, photos of the project" "Local II" "were presented to make the present a renovation" "tasty". ""</seg>

<seg id="2709">"Steven Northway, 33, implanted the tiny chip between thumb and forefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"he joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultative anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards."</seg>

<seg id="2714">The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the particulars of the military, which were left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programmes."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, built in Connecticut, was issued alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or Frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the assistant naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning and stayed for so long until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team for the return flight would be required.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original airliner was during the event at the helicopter, while the security guards of the unit stayed on the floor during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records provided by the TIME did not make clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you were shut up," replied the Deputy Commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president announced an impetus for the reform of the health reform, which was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to insulate government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to request their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential jet led against the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled by the show" "Made in America" "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," "said the assistant secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews are frequent training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to enforce U.S. President at the White House with precise centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as a trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted in the training requirements of the flight crew for the month, a civil servant said."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helikopter units additionally flew 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">The unit records the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopters for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that are made in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on them."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire brigade."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very good," "said the president," "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2762">Team Principal Marius Zay at any rate has respect for the opponent.</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is a compact team that always plays a similar formation.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"on the back positions I find the crew very good." ""</seg>

<seg id="2777">How America can harm OMV</seg>
<seg id="2778">"actually, Donald Trump did not work when he put his signature under the law for the tightening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2779">"in his rush to enact the law," "Congress packed a few" "constitutional provisions", "he estimated."</seg>
<seg id="2780">"the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shamed against the U.S. advance."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"since then, domestic OMV investors, together with other European companies, have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region North Stream 2."</seg>
<seg id="2783">The threatening is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="2784">"nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, such as the official statement of the oil corporation."</seg>

<seg id="2798">The city organises the Kita lunch table itself.</seg>
<seg id="2799">With fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team.</seg>
<seg id="2800">"in the city's day-to-day centres, the clock is reversed."</seg>
<seg id="2801">"on 1 September, the town of Krefeld takes over the provision of food to the municipal kindergartens (Kitas) in self-control."</seg>
<seg id="2802">"for Sonja Pomeranz, assistant director in the field of youth welfare, this is good news:" we were all very pleased. "</seg>
<seg id="2803">Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the city runs 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"last year, 2800 children sat at the tables and the demand is growing steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"meanwhile, not only children who are cared for at least 45 weekdays in the Kita lunch," explains Pomeranz. "</seg>
<seg id="2807">The offer is also valid in 35-hour supervision when children stay until 2 pm.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"46 participants from 1 September have kitchen service: they warm up the local dishes, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, proportioning the meal individually, give the food out, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="2809">"the employees are permanently assigned to a Kita," says Pomeranz. "</seg>
<seg id="2810">The size - there are two groups as well as seven-rank facilities - decides on the scope of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the kitchen assistants are now firmly on the Kita team," "says Pommersheim."</seg>
<seg id="2812">"so they are much more involved, and it is easier for kitesurfing to implement pedagogical concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"for this reason, it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons."</seg>
<seg id="2814">Children should help prepare meals.</seg>
<seg id="2815">The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Also for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2817">"they have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."</seg>
<seg id="2818">This continuity is important for children.</seg>
<seg id="2819">The purge of the Kita-rooms - until now also the task of the chicks - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm, which it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical, it is from the press office."</seg>

<seg id="2855">"GMB Senior organiser Drew Duffy said:" "the fact that we can't gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, our members are deeply concerned."</seg>

<seg id="2866">"the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, whereby Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen will continue for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are the Church, "declared after publication against the German press agency, he was waiting for the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve to the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret concerning their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" "Osservatore Romano", "on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen" "two measures" "was measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in view of the attacks in Regensburg, no one knows that it is" shameful and shameful deeds, "which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as source of all evil is already part of everyday experience, preparing public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also commented on Bayerischer Rundfunk in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "one likes to go to the church and this is a boned fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "strikes have been a quite normal educational tool", "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the reminder book" My brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is presented in the 440-page report commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of over grips, 67 dome-cats sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotion, the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other accusations, many victims appreciate the general Humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "Georg Ratzinger" "is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence from violence to shelters at shelters "Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which became handy when a dome set musically does not have a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"to him, eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him at best, to know of it too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents - so literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also present a very excellent testimony, describes it as" warm, "" popular, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teachers who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by children "grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains of its perfectionism and its high level of emotionality, which also led to brute eruptions."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he didn't just knead on the ground with chairs and threw the keyboards on the ground, but also gave ear-feigned and too cheeky boys to the hair or ears, he has already admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state secondary school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and violent excesses at the pre-school, these are certainly digging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as a result, one wonders if it is not more familiar with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many people who never understood him are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, there was a great deal of abuse on the topic of abuse at the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also have some involvement or complicity in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the dome master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said a saddened representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in Enlightenment was sexual abuse and yet is that most victims of shame remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even confide to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who had been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an inquiring student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it was calculated... Buben insistent or clearer, or even sooner rather than vis-à-vis their parents, dormitory leaders, trustees, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That talking to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with a clear result:" that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, George Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to an ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violent excesses" "was read by the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former" "Domkapellmeister" "Georg Ratzinger is accused of taking a" "look". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in reporting everything has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, there is clearly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence and, we say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from time since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were shuffled and maligned and suffered, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject" Primary School "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims estimated the overall humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the accusation remains to have looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again by 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," "that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time, as a legal clarity, as testing penalties were long banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows yet."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" Fallstrick of Anachronism, "i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to modern moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was used in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent childrens, that goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am glad that it is finally worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. earfigs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has given Georg Ratzinger, because in the conversations with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing as well as the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not deny that there was a strictest regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't even make a big singer and stand before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can't imagine that he could even do something wrong with a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly contact him, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today to enrich their lives and bring them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to whom they still look at today and which they are almost honouring."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that is presented to it are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the scapegoat for the scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably knows no one to know the Regensburg Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
