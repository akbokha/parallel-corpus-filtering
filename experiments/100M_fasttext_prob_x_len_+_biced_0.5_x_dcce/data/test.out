&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother testi@@ fied that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; finally he went up with him . &quot;

the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston earlier , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shocked and destroyed about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia suggested that Frank lived in host@@ els first , but that , &quot; &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his way to his family was to always cook something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ finished diamond that lit up every day , &quot; he said . &quot;

Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glu@@ ed from outside Label , which with me and reality mostly have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I myself have not the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather sc@@ ru@@ ffy . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
&quot; the actress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front TV with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs from us on August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the trophy
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
&quot; for the 58 year old , it was a premiere . &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their celebrations , they hun@@ ted home for the feeding trou@@ ghs in a quick gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
&quot; he had to lead his family to the AL@@ RV site , on a horse he didn &apos;t even catch himself for a photo . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden sports pyramid .
there is no shortage of hon@@ ours to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
&quot; national Cross , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means very much to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social engagement . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes young talent . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the reti@@ re Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company hi@@ ked into the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza Prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and m@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing trade agreements T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential candidates , however , are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a prin@@ ci@@ pled , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely rep@@ atri@@ ate regulations , and it will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says , &quot; The state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes would increase for the rich , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in that must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot;
the democratic candidate is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions could be given . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate coal mining in the US .
oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Convention .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand and demand the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; these should be paid even better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage does not have to be changed , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , at least asking for the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid programmes in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are avi@@ aries .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women Help Centre . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - neither as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hopes for hope . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many steal secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs for example ask for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who think that the end , as soon as she holds in Germany , irrit@@ ates , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and mis@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experienced , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often fail to help , there need more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the question , whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is no such thing in housing of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , escaped women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are housed separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need for protection , one can read the urge to go to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistant specialists strike : demands for new labour campaign measures
representatives of the assistance specialists have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaign activities in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for the whole Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract that has been agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; persistent quietly &quot; &quot; to problems , which led the contract to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating working activities that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in the fact that assistants of this year were striking six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA resident physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared the B@@ MA members during sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed allied and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan might have beha@@ ved like never had happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; building up again becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan had prof@@ ited his own family from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been given up close to his office last month , with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late Imperial ons@@ lau@@ ght in the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television would appro@@ ve fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as it was in response to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge over the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ red to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in favour of the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit at this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y one as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have been bre@@ ached and treated badly from the West and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peace @-@ makers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they didn &apos;t even take the subject again . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey denied it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found on Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey f@@ lowed the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s head of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand shall only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC &apos;s Scotland that the brand R@@ BS was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; it supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange at Nat@@ West will be changed . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for retail customers that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investor brand and the brand , among which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to move to the Bank of the Mar@@ ches , as how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he bet on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too .
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pic@@ ks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career bars &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have thrilled fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he would have scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already ger@@ min@@ ated almost 30 years in the UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin mo@@ bs Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin in@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the closest confi@@ den@@ ess of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that without giving reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s had ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in Tallinn &apos;s Est@@ onian capital , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the protocol and the staff of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state , in terms of bill of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ant , working as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who once was praised as a potential President , suddenly would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once , it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , approaching ally Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .

puzzles to fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four locks of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lashes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Keith Brown &apos;s economic minister took a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when constructing the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the de@@ cks today gets a concrete casting for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the expansion of the northern tower , we had to close the gap to the north or south side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards when incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they only ru@@ de only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive
three men were lucky enough to be alive after they were thrown by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty breathing in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was around and we faced the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boar@@ der without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone today awak@@ ened these men .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ based perpetr@@ ator dis@@ car@@ ded the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ er@@ ted then his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companion .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschweig @-@ cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken much more seriously in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD will propose a &quot; action concept living &quot; at the next Council meeting .
but conflict is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all the apartments available as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the low @-@ priced apartments can also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the main point in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to grow at least 10 percent in such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the flats are built as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed , is to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement at the moment between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors .
&quot; despite this , as viol@@ ist , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do we compare the loss of other around 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought bor@@ rowing from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into price fixing . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at one blow , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; because in the western city , at the end of the year , dead@@ lines run out . &quot;
some 1800 apartments could be brought back to price fixing for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is again dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called interference . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must enter into the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ emon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and last to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der , and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 3@@ 5,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people running 30 minutes each day , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to bring &quot; &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people who look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ um@@ eric players who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to play sports as it does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bal@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ campaign title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected her last review in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women at the Winter Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the female co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost a competition competition , a series of winners that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; although Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture ble@@ ached . &quot;
bri@@ be beams and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world title - lau@@ ded .
she resum@@ ed with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar again - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced her gently when she expected her enc@@ amp@@ ment - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina continued . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called O@@ ma , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her ground exercise she kick@@ ed down the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who have been killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in the first series of kill@@ ings of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ f@@ eit , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at , whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in His@@ pan@@ ian residential areas within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ in from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were connected and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which went on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ qui@@ ties , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let go of it .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund can never see her under certain circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a hearing aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but he slowly advances .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought of &quot; Please sing something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him character language , &quot; &quot; tells Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is too early to tell how it will affect the life of those with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional value of an uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I do not expect that she can really tell me someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ds in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call on the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ iana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Edwards reported that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags continued . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louis@@ iana to Saturday .
the weather service showed that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday as it continues to be raining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river COM@@ ITE near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Louis@@ iana , will all probability be reached after the weekend record level . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ ban neighbor@@ hoods near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a stream @-@ downstream over@@ flow in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers run only slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ f@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still kno@@ cked people out of the flood in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that waters of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet away from his house , increased over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him . &quot;
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water poured and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the han@@ di@@ caps and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly since there continued heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities should take into account ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was significantly weigh@@ ed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a coun@@ cill@@ or in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , staff were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood , and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ down said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses have been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday they have not been reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; er@@ ased by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tell that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lung , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; det@@ ectives told C@@ BS Philadelphia , that it seems to have come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wn up the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing fight .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; thus , there seems to have been several armed fighters involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; said police spokes@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; at present , there was no arrest and the police report@@ edly reviewed the monitoring video . &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse r@@ ack@@ et when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic leadership and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gym@@ n@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gym@@ n@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they did unexpected , but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so gym@@ nasi@@ um classes don &apos;t look like in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to bring it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ n@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that gym@@ n@@ asts are a more expensive sport and gym@@ nas@@ tics are primarily used in private gym@@ nas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ n@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these Turn@@ clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Gym@@ nas@@ tics get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gym@@ n@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the communities au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training . &quot;
I founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable prices in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( mostly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gym@@ nas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to interest in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 resident doctors voted for a vote . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ time and weekend work to improve the maintenance of un@@ ast@@ o@@ unding times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the B@@ MA Committee for Regist@@ rar , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistant doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will inc@@ ur the current situation crisis and to treat all doctors with justice . &quot;
&quot; at just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors are falling under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of B@@ MA to resolve conflicts with the government on the reluc@@ tance to engage and sometimes to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened in the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made only last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the raise and address the worries of the assistants .
&quot; if he does not do this , the doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA aims to provide a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 resident specialists who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , asked the assistants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not reach little , but are already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the assistance doctors &apos; committee and had a positive response with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries with regard to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of training schedule , training vac@@ ations and gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Health Department regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medication , which can lower heart attack risk &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medicine after being advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the drug @-@ inhibit@@ ing drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medicine is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls causing pla@@ que .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots are dissolved , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able .
&quot; the preliminary draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month dose of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively is in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rec@@ t culture boo@@ sts voters in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles interven@@ es verb@@ ally the police , election observers and Rath@@ au@@ gers to have ignored evidence of electoral ab@@ uses due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now a antagon@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tape outside of electoral cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
it is recommended that voters should have an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , when they submit their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he ur@@ ges that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial bet@@ g culture associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ andal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be enth@@ r@@ alled after a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis , that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation , in which a person chooses to be someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - if the older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including guiding principles to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it states : &quot; &quot; evidence was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the older , especially communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit correspondence documents to stop &quot; &quot; elec@@ tive harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social distress . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic correspondence .
prohibition that political activists deal with full postal elections and envel@@ opes of postal elections .
the police force the authority to set off barriers for election stations .
a change of law that facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation due to inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Auth@@ orities Act 1983 ) .
photography ban in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of training , to ensure that employees prevail the rule that voters go alone into the elec@@ tive cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty . &quot;
&quot; the court appe@@ aled to Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ torate @-@ registration departments of the Town Houses . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and covered disper@@ sion of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be surprised by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and the band , which proved to be an impressive bi@@ enni@@ al in the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ lete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic ceramics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see a great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the UK Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the pool , the South African float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one gang higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption .
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
Twitter User@@ in explained her satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ ons in the Gab@@ by Douglas Tur@@ ns , which has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC commentary for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese Flo@@ ats died like a pig

&quot; Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he ended up at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor pool staff@@ el his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was caught on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as she called M@@ ief , she died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emma Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eted , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ u@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard where many people asked him
Twitter users didn &apos;t stay back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comments of a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ al via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users , compl@@ aining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements have been made , and that it has been made possible to broadcast them . &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night to our spectators on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
&quot; in order to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used himself in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was conceived as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the squ@@ ad@@ ron squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ programm , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who tried sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman drew her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try sau@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at them as she looked at it , and put her back into the shelf again . &quot;
they continued and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the tray , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and ta@@ sted her . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone was star@@ ing when she with@@ drew the trousers , which you obviously did not like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sub@@ h@@ osen , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t fall back and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants which she had ta@@ sted .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; as be@@ ati@@ ful to think that someone would take sub@@ h@@ osen with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of sau@@ c@@ ers and find out that another woman had left her and went out and they were not washed .
&quot; Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been pulled out of the sale .
how to protect yourself against attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a little more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should first turn around so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knees and turn , while the att@@ acker cr@@ ushes against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and rotate it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is done in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to over@@ ride your money , unless you are a Grand@@ master Kra@@ v Mag@@ a . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right che@@ ats his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and thro@@ wer to a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ used his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sin@@ ge button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot;
&quot; the thought to le@@ ak the rin@@ se button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he spotted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate unique and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to train stations to dish@@ washing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task posed its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film , he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to le@@ ak after their L@@ umin@@ ometer Range was over 4000 units , while newly @-@ washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacterial count at different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That comes to the worst thing I did in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dir@@ tier than that !
I will not stop here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in bow@@ el health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;

I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me tell you that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I instruc@@ ted him , just like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to le@@ ak it and others where it was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .

&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed in front of del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls had fl@@ ax@@ ed holes , wooden boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror , which had joined the family , consisted of street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cri@@ es , disputes and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police
Corn@@ wall Housing Del@@ og@@ ated her and her partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by reli@@ eved neighbors who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They weren &apos;t afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always terrible .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be aw@@ ful .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the ground &quot;
&quot; workers of the house administration will now have to throw garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found himself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial custody . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money for a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will del@@ og@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police shared that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal moved into panic after a ti@@ eff@@ ected military jet flies on the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces put an unbelievable crash
&quot; air strikes showed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists started to panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ ected jet was crashing over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me .
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
&quot; today , the Portuguese aviation forces announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to see them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet , due to the poor visibility of space , flew lower than usual due to poor visibility , however , the air forces insi@@ sted that security at no time was endangered . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people were killed on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese aviation forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his sight &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Sevilla - The FC Barcelona will compete on Sunday for the first step in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans step out in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the return leg climbs three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Double@@ war@@ ner must abst@@ ain in the balance of forces with the subordin@@ ate Cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing .
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one for two years .
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique has ren@@ ounced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but nevertheless T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of the rest of the votes cast off . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know how to convince at 3 : 2 in the trial at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .

Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and the title def@@ ender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.3 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ z@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title one among each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic meeting was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time outs , they had no aches . &quot;
&quot; they had gone back to the tri@@ b@@ une , leaving their cont@@ ests in a fair competition on their own . &quot;
&quot; the matches , until here , I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequently . &quot;

after that he set up the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , it did not develop the expected ro@@ using match . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump cleared ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his campaign in the United Republic of Utah up to now .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within his own Repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in key federal states such as Ohio , Florida and Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame is false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media coverage . &quot;
Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ down
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard in June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were charged with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he doesn &apos;t make anything else , as &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to remove mon@@ ies to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better read@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger under the arms . &quot;
Olympic : three Twi@@ ster Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C aims to establish a disciplinary mission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes threat@@ ens after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer to Kenya . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately establish a disciplinary mission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team management Ken@@ ias from the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to make their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person shared . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was said in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and acted as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , released and signed the sample , &quot; &quot; stated Ken@@ ias President de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes who stood on the list for the training controls of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i became more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics deleg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from the Rio Games .
he should have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya is currently under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing tre@@ aties .
&quot; when the IO@@ C announced more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks before the Rio Games , unusual athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer months in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; in consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this type of sport this sport became widespread and systematic . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony as the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli says the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the play is still relevant .
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family , shortly after she had decided to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it to go into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London entered an airplane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married a IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain in the case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the dec@@ eased judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday , during a telephone conference , that he expects &quot; &quot; Clinton to expect Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land , and he spec@@ ulates . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants to play naked women for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distingu@@ ishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that it does the Calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the Cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass @-@ cur@@ sed
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Dialog Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already passed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef def@@ ed the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the travel pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Federation demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on appeal to numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum rights recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all as eligible for asylum ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves remun@@ er@@ ated against war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum Rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country day .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; 2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid than so far , it &apos;s not : summer holidays , heat and land fighting - that is bit@@ ing . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors are on holiday .
&quot; most tourists who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up voices are just lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the Feri@@ a , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania must once again let their election campaign go over to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strongly newcom@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ du@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive campaign , one sees from his large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it also did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has gotten cold feet and Angela Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oms of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create it , &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him probably the most beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its nickname candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale protests . Merkel &apos;s German parliament is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ East @-@ CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that said , Kok@@ ert , only plays an &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that , on the country , you are br@@ ushing the base that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral batt@@ ali@@ on Kok@@ ert , however , is self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village festivals , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the vacation @-@ need and spend their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral champ@@ ions go to search for native voters among the holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from block@@ ages
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end at about 8@@ pm , there are no praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything pretty cris@@ p , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated south@@ wards to the south at the start of the year , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; praise will also be the opposite of those responsible for building work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of heating systems . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and the barrier of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the town has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comforts , &quot; says the deputy chief executive director Florian King for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ ep paths were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were confused .
&quot; as the speed limits did not meet , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant sur@@ ges , &quot; says King , who himself made himself able to know himself about the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been blown .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 hours of hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 renovation has led to sales growth in them , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment hardly has consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; but also adm@@ its that of course , &quot; the running documentary is missing . &quot;
the most heavily @-@ captured are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; in addition , the sales revenue is based on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street painting has thrown his farm &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there would be a financial compensation , otherwise the host prof@@ ited from the advantages of the situation on the B . 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other districts where such a lot has been handled .
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; that his stem cells come back again after the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of counter @-@ terrorism , it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has now presented a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they are not demanding anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in it . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister of the Interior , however , he is located on results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; however , these are all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some are already known , announced , announced : that a new safety authority should take care of the cr@@ acking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; neither is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines for passenger data and weapons law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come as surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère dis@@ covers a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to pun@@ ish sympath@@ etic groups under punishment and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this reasonable and also demanding nothing that does not have any chances at the co @-@ operation partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast @-@ release procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
&quot; refugees who are picked up specifically into the country should check their smartphones in advance , and reveal social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; in Dul@@ ations for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some also seem un@@ even and leaves questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient ones , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to conclude that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the high number of refugees concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that were deeply involved in people , were not allowed to complain about in election times too . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went up high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ dener argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , where the R@@ ess@@ ort @-@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working here to make con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a desc@@ endant from the double pass , he is nothing . &quot;
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to open up new , be not reasonable . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own parcel is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , only must show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause disputes .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to benefit from the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further increase security . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen is getting worse . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel and@@ als , the distribution numbers are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but not all markets are running around .
&quot; in the recall campaign , vor@@ tices are about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts on deliveries to the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand , VW , weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sale as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a sales restra@@ int in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , a spokes@@ person explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus of be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales split . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW has re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certificate to the customer , the car manufacturer does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as promised on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reasons to be j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal fin@@ esse .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen weigh@@ ed its German customers now a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come back to a workshop half a year after conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer &apos;s interest , too , it is important to avoid any damage that has nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ sc@@ andal , to a contamination with regard to possible warranty regulations , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich as@@ parag@@ us in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , Bank CEO Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; ordinary austerity &quot; &quot; would not be afraid of paying for its harsh criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he jump@@ ed 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; after the poll@@ uter @-@ principle , the cost is now passed on . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash just lie in the saf@@ es of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank executive . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy will cause significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear you alone , be &quot; business @-@ economically not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal charges for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ ge- and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , but the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little more abundant by fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they charge money for free . &quot;
&quot; established in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no further banks are known to calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to compete . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
loving middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comments section , to over@@ load it under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ all@@ ot@@ eric backgrounds with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attribut@@ able to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely female group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers do not retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit , and I &apos;m gaz@@ ing wil@@ dly before I &apos;m standing , holding my hands and deciding on something like that : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o slowly enters its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men middle @-@ aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men middle age , a woman , presum@@ ably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford when it appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are seeing themselves buying their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have to get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record @-@ revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves , from objects that aw@@ aken happy it@@ ching memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s the case with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; a staff of a record stack fl@@ utes .
&quot; a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , haven &apos;t heard them yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I leaf@@ y through a pile of Bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe , has a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; I do not own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ like , less music @-@ like . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in . &quot;
&quot; stop , which has devoted the record to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I &apos;m walking . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ be@@ packed pop , instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ones out of the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks odd , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards available for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to make a shopping sp@@ ree than a shopping mall .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collection of records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to show the jeans @-@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ rolling through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through panels , while they avoid the star@@ ry view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old Moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders none of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 temporary businesses in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the provisional business and restaurants often offered accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who run the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is fu@@ tile operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as providing advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure was &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two help organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new bl@@ itz devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for accident @-@ related issues , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to plum@@ bing bridges with temporary tem@@ ple@@ t there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bl@@ ater for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile assembly can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operations . the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be collected over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through messages by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly experienced condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sweat @-@ resistant outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the shar@@ pen@@ er from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic data in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities are spra@@ ying with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year . &quot;
Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets fet@@ ched
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ day Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day , could fall back on it in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult road behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under Ryan . &quot;
here they lose only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wondering and let the attacks jump out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au r@@ ushed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a temporary T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB was still se@@ eded . &quot;
that &apos;s how it is .
GB brought fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through a brilliant mid @-@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ p@@ ans whose fans sw@@ ung flags , sw@@ ung flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whist@@ le sounded that Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and kick@@ ed kick@@ ed in the grass .
&quot; earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no emot@@ ive gold in these games and that &apos;s what you want .
&quot; from the first rowing to the last 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they ru@@ ined the second Olympic champion in the second without a control woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , which laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ 3 unlimited use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each of the gold in the rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no more an ordinary coach , who would survive 30 months ago when diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the correct term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were sufficient . &quot;
that &apos;s how it begins .
&quot; rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with it more than ever talking and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even over the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let oneself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about the future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the big water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk ( Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk ) .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Francon@@ ia wor@@ shipped the co@@ er@@ ci@@ on association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; is regarded as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es , stood for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes around 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water delivery contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ constructions of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still and I have always added new innovations , because water life and drinking water are the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association , and he has lived in real life for the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia area . &quot;
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Aqu@@ arius Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a faithful scar@@ let .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ making and restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ tag on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; once again , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am and wounded her in a deadly way .
&quot; the man himself ph@@ oned with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am openly flag@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
but it is a couple of years old .
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; Rel@@ ation@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any statements on the day @-@ to @-@ day or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but she confirmed that a person had been killed . &quot;
it is a killing deli@@ ri@@ um .
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special kom@@ mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that were threatened by the industry from green electricity extraction are from the table .
&quot; the German steel industry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) remains in the liberation of the renewable energy supply in the German steel industry . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we finally managed to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the ste@@ el@@ works , an E@@ EG over@@ lay is 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is future , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment objectives are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation became more ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ wers threw steel on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers introduce price dump@@ ing Chinese steel corporations .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand imposed import duties on import steel have effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have been ero@@ ded . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price @-@ collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; finally , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to close the closing of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , some 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic unification reported steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the finished quantity went back to the second month after a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has grown by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has been accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good with her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; due to the regular assembly , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also taken Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir , &quot; &quot; Cre@@ ating and organizing herself to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , &quot; &quot; says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; because in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs become not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs by older people awak@@ ens a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia suffer@@ ers are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ sel@@ or &apos;s choir , you can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , tra@@ itors H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively than tom@@ cats at the cri@@ es of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover what effect the rep@@ ut@@ ment of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equally in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the excitement of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ sts of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to the lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great distress , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical University of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sts of less and heavily reg@@ ated young animals are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of significance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens was different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight males from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of MH@@ H were observed .
they were pre @-@ played for a few ch@@ icks which were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the small sample , the researchers consider their results conclusi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the sh@@ outs , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls played the very more excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to inf@@ ants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is taking place again an important football match . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in July , the government , the daily routine of normal br@@ ush@@ ers , was not affected by the arrest of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it is also not possible to stop football . &quot;
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution ordered an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the meanwhile living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kü@@ r shall be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of exception is still valid for 90 days until October , in fact , it has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the night &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the staff club Bes@@ ik@@ tas do not belong to the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , it is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch . &quot;
fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; , &quot; it will arrive particularly on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the ex@@ pi@@ red season proved his sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first game time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ k.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; f@@ arewell to the Europa League early . &quot;
&quot; in the South per Li@@ g , it was only ranked sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 races of the season as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rif@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the same time , the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas had only announced Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation not to return . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce approximately one third of his estimated to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whist@@ le blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova should not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Athle@@ tics sinners can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the issue of dop@@ ing depends on the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compl@@ ained shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was f@@ aded and bu@@ ked at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
it was a bizarre scene : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still in front of the hall and prov@@ oked her performance .
&quot; as a stron@@ gh@@ old that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who go to the start in Rio in spite of the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he has been blocked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 , after you had been det@@ ained by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion in 2013 and European champ@@ ionships , was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant medium meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Per@@ kovic denied the sei@@ z@@ ure of knowledge , and was locked for six months . &quot;
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and was closed 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , bet@@ eu@@ red Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been subsequently recognised as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games was also held back due to a judgment of the International Sports Court , CAS . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champ@@ ionships , evidence of taking a banned food supplement has been found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry spokes@@ man , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
her home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , two explosive rates were raised , while another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; when det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , popular seaside resorts , a taxi driver was injured . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory police . &quot;
&quot; after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast were several injured . &quot;
&quot; one goes from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Mond@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves with possible motives - but probably it is , however , about the deeds of the Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insurrection movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age restricted to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; the authorities would have kept secret evidence on im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country in recent days , but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; it is still unclear , which group is behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police ran their officials across the country to strengthen security around important governmental buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of them are not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to make sure that the instructions of the Thai security authorities will necessarily follow . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after con@@ front@@ ations between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to travel to these provinces before travelling . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to steal chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , retained itself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the insur@@ rec@@ tionary rebellion of the Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
almost one year ago in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; has come into the sight of the Federal Office of constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; after several provincial offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identified movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic fundamental order , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen , the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ using in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional obj@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identified &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ths said , his authority worked closely with the local authorities in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of Islam as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a bet@@ u@@ able promotion for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports on contacts of the &quot; identified &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
Ma@@ ths said that he had no knowledge .
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the substantial increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ja said that he would not talk about new right @-@ wing terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have stated in recent years that there can be ri@@ cious @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it can be quite possible that further anti @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ths concerned themselves with many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the alleg@@ ations in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts that might have been politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by far @-@ right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olymp@@ ion@@ ics or world records determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ represented countries better known .
&quot; as in Ethiopia , most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names started the lap .
some media marked him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; was funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he first beat a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ estyle , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to face a 100 @-@ metre free @-@ style ride alone . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympia only eight months before the competition and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
&quot; at an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her according to a truck , which was partially driving on the counter @-@ road . &quot;
the bus arrived right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back by a regular bus to the Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ ner District of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter eff@@ lu@@ ent will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new village of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ig@@ h 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.10 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the sewage costs will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an excessive calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) reported , the approval of the budget was established by the Council of Agriculture Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants under@@ cover . &quot;
&quot; due to legal grounds , the Kaz@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ ig@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to go deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calendar period can be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Schmidt founded the gra@@ vit@@ ational increases in charge of all three wast@@ ewater facilities with a very low waste water incident between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sewage flow in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the back calculation period of all three plants , due to their age , plum@@ bing and repair expenses have fallen into a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ig@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing station Wel@@ ig@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;

&quot; stone houses made clear that in the case of small wast@@ ewater treatment in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were thoroughly investigated . &quot;
&quot; in the process , Schmidt added that the market community has spar@@ ed large entertainment costs for wast@@ ewater facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater @-@ purpose association , because it is about san@@ itation facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria falls for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average inflation rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; Leisure and Culture ( 6.3 % ) ; Restaurants and Hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month period of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian cartoon
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ ur@@ red , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all the missing entries are sent to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised itself in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when a filter proposed some users this week , which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow light . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversy had pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others declined the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et became widespread about the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; vulnerable &quot; &quot; was said to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian carto@@ ons and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not in@@ secure , but that the yellow light has been drag@@ ged into the ab@@ used extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race than their older opponents - might assume more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was previously the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ ed @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the introduction practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leaders , and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or good to speak about . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a staff responsible , focusing on sub@@ divided population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; IS@@ IS military service fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to sign an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions were allowed on the ground , an investig@@ ative committee of the Congress held in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican members of the Armed Forces Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Defence Committee , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command &apos;s secret services analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically ma@@ iled by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it had allowed actual states on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , noted . &quot;
the management error in Cent@@ com reaches up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indication that government tips under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors to sign an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com affiliated publicly announced that a military re @-@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Congress Member of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peak of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after being admitted to them , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence services on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; the morality of analysts said and &quot; gave excessive space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon chief inspec@@ tor , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress &apos;s reports while investigating the General In@@ spec@@ torate is still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ percus@@ sions on the question of a successful campaign of air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has since been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s alleg@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writer about how the former government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq , and a little time went on to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker insi@@ sts that contrary to the government statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature on account of his exc@@ essi@@ vely positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced with Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States wins fourth consecutive match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , this is true : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first place will take the strong Dutch a little longer to lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind due to their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ sl@@ ayer in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the working capital in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India was gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game in their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning stick , which is handed over from the w@@ rist@@ band to the gym@@ n@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ decker or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with dimples , could well have been among these known names that would be sent to the Prime Time , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ oline tur@@ ne . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ plate and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived as spar@@ sely the last 16 years that many people I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it is an Olympic portal at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping , and until 2012 had had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has some out@@ sider char@@ ms , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an ear@@ nest enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the Gra@@ zie of gym@@ nas@@ tics and diving , which combines two kinds of sports . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ encing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic Committee , they are evaluated according to performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to go to gold in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes go and back , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also another higher goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel as something ti@@ ring when looking at these games .
&quot; of this , the tramp@@ oline offers a breathing break . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abo@@ lition of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely over@@ looked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the spru@@ ce and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. gym@@ n@@ asts recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia , push for violent resistance to the government . &quot;
witnesses testi@@ fied that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and turned into ever more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people attacked the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses testi@@ fied that police officers shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Commission now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations continued oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden that have been defeated in the past few years or were forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arming themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of falling under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improved internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were so much assembled .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , mainly come to Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes exactly .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ek@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is in@@ war@@ dly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ers who constitute about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special mand@@ ates to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ am@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am came from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections that were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the past months and that time of un@@ rest went by relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their measur@@ able progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ appropri@@ ation of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ish city , conducted by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently reported that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump states his statement Obama has been based on IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible to the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its comrades , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculiar position to explain the statements he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was referring to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism depends on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand values . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton thought about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should ch@@ op Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the language boundaries in politics and then rowing as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his survey values continued . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps has brought his loyal colleagues into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , was struggling to defend candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have formed the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ war@@ ers , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread it aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; poor , un@@ fortunate &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Rever@@ ie &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , there is a coffee shop in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a very nice cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years served good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop was pushed out . &quot;
&quot; soap ch@@ erie store , set up in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people rob@@ bed it as a last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is a change , then it is also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
verb utili@@ zes the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and sour onions . &quot;
there are natural travel keys .
&quot; the café doesn &apos;t serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a constant stream of old tribal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg earlier and regularly visited the club . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to herself . &quot;
&quot; after the club closed , she gave up coffee drinking a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the club that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably always ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment , that the soap store had taken the old business space . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he prepared to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; opened as the new café , Wh@@ itt told that entering the restaurant and the best of a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a g@@ our@@ mets President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
&quot; his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man was told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop , a small , sn@@ aff@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; as the repor@@ ter min@@ ted , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that the ingredient stretches .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; shows the ways in which the country was going to be no longer the country of arms . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central theme , &quot; explained Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was also ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mix@@ tures were tried out , because a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cuisine . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house business recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household products - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary women &quot; and the challenge to turn pamp@@ er like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
&quot; especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ stance . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
&quot; President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to leave a temple with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the how@@ ling of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also prepared one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with eating , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science has been applied to foods . &quot;
&quot; the couple presented the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better with writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
&quot; after the dishes were vac@@ ated by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ es@@ sert , the President Roosevelt , ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
each di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on@@ ful in the t@@ ines and brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civilian safety group , which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life to the game , to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian guards , showing him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans the shining symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie comes up with up to 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it depends on it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a full speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already suspected that Greenland ha@@ arks are stone age . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea from the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland ha@@ arks .
their slow @-@ motion measures they as they equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
&quot; this sh@@ arks still make this shar@@ k : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver who tor@@ ch from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ arks who took fishermen from Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen from Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks were notably carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the liner core , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in their lenses , all larger Greenland ha@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which origin@@ ates through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k at the age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 502 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females get offspring first , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ arks with propag@@ ation obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip was stuck , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a fl@@ ames . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets warmth .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
&quot; total : 5@@ 17,@@ 60EUR &quot;
&quot; with themes around building , the council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board announced the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after clari@@ fying the land , clearing and settlement issues , and the applications for survey@@ ing could be made , the sale of land plots in the residential construction areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) are no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet commun@@ e Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ro@@ am sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as mentioned above , Bau@@ wil@@ volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also en@@ qu@@ ire further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the area &apos;s plan of land use only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Lower Peri@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , the city in the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt has benefited most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Centre Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether some money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to appro@@ ve the United Kingdom . &quot;
this is currently using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight on the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities as well as the European Insurance Fund E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg holds a large fund industry , it also cuts out bad in the infrastructure as well as in Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of consultants Merc@@ er , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract additional banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; however , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead gains legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of legal costs incurred by the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ t from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ l and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a complaint on Thursday , US Secretary of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the cost incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead to regulate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained to each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir added , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops backed by the United States have conquered the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j , near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently in the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , told Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council appointed by the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are currently running clean @-@ up operations , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton has published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , and this resulted in the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary Bill Clinton obtained a revenue of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ca@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ pers Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ formers with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal to refuse . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the release of the presidential candidate for democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , m@@ umps of special advis@@ ors , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not finished . &quot;
&quot; the critics , among other things , also the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his commercial powers and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to release his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , called Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to the IR@@ S as well , and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published its tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a salary , different from the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9,000 c@@ logged . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der and fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant Protection
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements , they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective , and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion along with US nature protection , using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World &apos;s Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell said in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned over to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ des into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a thro@@ wer , which shoots a gold @-@ dre@@ aming fire@@ work in the air and thereby causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock , after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre@@ fix since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of hotels . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and eliminated ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; threw him , &quot; &quot; as he wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels management . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and pl@@ ung@@ ed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , where people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have recre@@ ated the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; it was said in another contribution , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; Israel did not include in the drop @-@ down list , &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police put Tr@@ än@@ gu@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met in Sao Paulo &apos;s Brazilian city with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police launched tear gas and rubber body@@ work against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to insert rubber body@@ shells and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters were looking for gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian enterprises in the country grew strongly , divided the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation issued approximately 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , first of all travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; searched for : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl , Germany &quot;
a rob@@ ber@@ y case was practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the help of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , asked the employee of the beverage brand to release cash and then fled first by foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 m tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly fores@@ ee@@ able .
&quot; after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel parking place situated opposite the par@@ quet entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have taken observations at the time ( at 7.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) observations that are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y of prey should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer holidays
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer release in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
in the quietly situated Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
for one thing we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other , to the Jews &apos; mu@@ le , where there was a special child@@ bearing in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to the jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their homemade cakes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Bed and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; workshops were be@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stries from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all of the mini@@ stries in the next two years , the round of mini@@ stries of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been checked and we finally decided to visit the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , during the Holy Year of Merc@@ y , a special pilgrimage goal was offered for the Holy Year of Merc@@ y . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ ces , went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , the pastor sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ enster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing lyrics . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches made a rest again and again to sing a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish hei@@ ms of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and forti@@ fying dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; on top of that , the stage was taken to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but had to conquer about 500 al@@ timet@@ ers in high heat and then be climbed again . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the well @-@ earned reward was a shared barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her . &quot;
&quot; after the dawn of the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at Frei@@ burger Münster and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
God ow@@ es with a small impulse here .
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were em@@ bos@@ sed . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold R@@ oot for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . the J@@ ump made the legend very proud when he stor@@ med home to win a win from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y picked up the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after taking place in March at the World Championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as an exec@@ ution@@ er .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw the potential in the ball@@ ast that has now developed . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner compet@@ ed in qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round , the New Zealand won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he was short , but Kenn@@ y took the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a major part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting it in a higher gear , to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
we placed an Olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally fell onto the track . &quot;
he later returned this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like London &apos;s flags at the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( an apparently sacred date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometer racing . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will certainly focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when function@@ aries were calling him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World@@ record time at 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a band to medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio have been shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama in the background , as well as the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mop@@ eds as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if you see the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of the GB@@ s , which has reached its climax for the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are standing in the game , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes , as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ down with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared the fact that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging businesses , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared the value of the contracts already written in his annual subscription to $ 187 million in &quot; expectation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is yet another explanation , why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity every year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and went to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , scre@@ ened reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n and the presence of the all @-@ loved Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ c@@ els and Produc@@ ers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . they all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é story@@ line almost every birthday episode of a child show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a broadcasting place at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her to see what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most selling edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertisers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ( 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot;
the revelation of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the magazine were still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model@@ ers &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , falls under the earlier category , it is in good society . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; Mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
&quot; these feelings boiled up again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover . &quot;
but to move around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal centers show up to 16@@ 0,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief figures are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of other aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unfair del@@ og@@ ations and similar - have been dismissed on free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ stretched , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal subsidies . &quot;
the governor of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal law centres revealed that thousands of people had already been dismissed every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be worse without the federal government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who were un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will shor@@ ten the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Minister of Justice , as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to raise these aver@@ ages immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of municipalities and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of having recru@@ ited weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was announced that their campaign manager for North Carolina did a fire@@ arm in February , while they were on the way in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted by Vincent Bord@@ ini on Wednesday , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini agreed to have been waiting for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , laid his right hand @-@ finger on the trigger , and sm@@ iled the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; said Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation ensu@@ es only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate broke out a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ ot@@ gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges . &quot;
&quot; the campaign made it clear that the media had torn its words from the context , and that it would not rise to violence . &quot;
B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for viol@@ ating the duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : losing the SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot;
this was representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could hardly rise further , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both states and would have good chances of continuing the head of government . &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite mess@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes at the beginning , that would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , though tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft . &quot;
the market today controls providers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were sold alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ going business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications providers come . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone has become a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al proc@@ ession of Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ a now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered to be a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olymp@@ ian spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring innovation and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London .
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies in the vicinity of He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new jobs alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that make money with online advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displaying entic@@ ements on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it reported that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block ads in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the enco@@ ding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicating that part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ bloc Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Stru@@ g@@ gle is underway between the time @-@ consuming open source community and the conver@@ ters since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has entered the battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lights have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use the display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times so much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising is 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has done it for ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers do not have an effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenue , so Facebook will make the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ pf@@ ish means , which is why we focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in susp@@ ects suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman was passed on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday when suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss lady , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill several vehicles , including a truck , himself wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as every witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter informed Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avo@@ idance ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark ran on the motorway , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligence after crossing a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court discovered that the polic@@ eman responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus probably was once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have shown similar conditions . &quot;
scientists previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly resum@@ ed . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth , but once there had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet explor@@ ers .
&quot; although it was once inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as her hydro@@ gene with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back down with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I was thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach in the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; standardis@@ ed oil workers res@@ ume talks , set out strikes &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles in respect of wages for the North Sea oil workers are suspended while all the armed parties sit on the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea conducted by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions , can confirm that we agreed to restart the process of the current stri@@ fe , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold a few full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible pay@@ outs of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional reductions will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alis@@ es its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ es@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rotate to different rates , as well as in which context the rotation @-@ periods with the planetary formation are . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ run , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now turning to the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these rip@@ ening stars push large amounts of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star sh@@ akes , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot in front of us that we would like to learn more about how , When and Why stars will slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star comes from
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional feedback , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the Tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees for the last time on August 12 . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to both , &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded a total of 27 million US dollars since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players present similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted into the hall of the bas@@ eball . &quot;
&quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet@@ ener . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; said Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , received the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ etic con@@ tours of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ery Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod &quot; , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; first of all , because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland won &apos;t start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official emer@@ gen@@ cies .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the end . &quot;
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the prec@@ urs@@ ors over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing has been applied . &quot;
&quot; the national association &quot; &quot; takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive itself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the banned substance is to act for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should also be positive already . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported to the Ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , approximately all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known on Friday , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days earlier positively to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both start taking the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , including the runner @-@ up of Kenya in Rio many bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the earlier versions of China had also caused severe conflicts between athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun stood at the center of an argument with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese champ@@ ionships 2014 on the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; data sheet : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ackers , their ran@@ som &quot;
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the solutions demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful , the potential to deliver ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of pollut@@ ants , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks happened in the past few months frigh@@ tening fast . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the reported German companies reported revenue losses caused by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute by the loss of sick@@ nesses . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , direct access to accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more prob@@ able that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers then sell their pollut@@ ants in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware @-@ Kits have been created by the malware itself , Consulting and additional Tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ jack then searches for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums on the ground , buying the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that can better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to convert ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone does not pose a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also completely take up new goals on the internet of things on the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the de@@ con conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat on the internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any position . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit surface falls off . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V during storage .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l at high @-@ power and 10@@ 26 l in the back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ ase bo@@ ilers and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the boot is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V , thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions . &quot;
&quot; however , he should make his work a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane Assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle at need the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger &apos;s bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued for a liability .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee strike at the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organizer
&quot; after their trip , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
&quot; in this case , a family suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ tle holiday . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers brought back the holiday@@ makers to a defective sewage plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea water . &quot;
the family was the view that the trip had been flaw@@ ed and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
&quot; before the court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organizers didn &apos;t know about them shortly before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no im@@ pur@@ ities have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through cont@@ ag@@ ion among each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were considered .
&quot; after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , Mai@@ zi@@ ère said many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be cau@@ ti@@ ously and decis@@ i@@ vely re@@ acting to terrorist threats .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and spl@@ itting . &quot;
we will not give this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement proposals until the election of the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in average four @-@ digit scale orders over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance has to be improved , the tru@@ ce is so novel@@ ty that , above all , the purchase of weapons in the internet is more difficult . &quot;
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should remain intact after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the citizen may be reduced , he said with a view of psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .
for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further increase security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister has clearly expressed itself against action . &quot;
&quot; this was an ear file for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / C@@ SU , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abo@@ lition of double citizenship .
he considers a general ban on the enforcement of the full @-@ veil on constitutional law .
&quot; it is not possible to for@@ bid everything one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to talk about rules , for example in traffic or for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; green @-@ boss Simone Peter designed the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and action . &quot;
&quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a sharp@@ ening of the right of residence bring man no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the auto@@ bahn
it is regularly st@@ owed on the reverse road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who are in traffic at the ambient street every evening in traffic when they drive through the auto@@ bahn &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger &quot; &quot; ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , the road construction will extend the road between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then turn right from the hammer onto the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic divi@@ des early on , thus improving the total circulation schedule on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
driving on the train on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is driving drivers mostly between 17 and 7 pm .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return traffic reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only on a single track via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load @-@ bearing force , in order to mainly include heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected workshop daily traffic jam will continue , the responsible state cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years have to be reck@@ oned : for the bridge has an official remaining use time up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal department , the state @-@ company deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays , because with disabilities it is to be expected . &quot;
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offerings for schools
the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater now plan a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to facilitate the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit the cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young@@ sters in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and we@@ aken little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background should have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the area of theat@@ rical play and theat@@ rical mediation are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ bu@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the Sou@@ thwest Germany in the night to Friday a line made by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ den , which is one of the fastest star@@ ters with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
they have their name because they seem to come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around for hours , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you don &apos;t have to think about sleep much more in the morning . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another condition .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially during a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eder . &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
&quot; for example , those who have a disk failure can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der over everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look different : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleep medi@@ ator in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleep problems one should first turn to the GP , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
it can clarify with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to the sleeping laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise for example in snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of disease fatigue , for in@@ som@@ nia or if one does not find the cause of a drow@@ sy disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cr@@ acking , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling distingu@@ ishes sleep @-@ ends . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of bolts on which one can set for a better sleep .
&quot; there is no need to sleep , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , stopping drinking alcohol and not at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he scored gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected him via Facebook in front of his ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle person € 150,000 , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming pool is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be stopped , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled by independent inspec@@ tors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A for some time before WM / OS must not take part , &quot; demands the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Lo@@ cks arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf Police succeeded in taking two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport again recognized a gang , which was known to the police of the past theft @-@ del@@ ici@@ aries . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were very professional and very professional .
&quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstrate four acts , specifically to carry out criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not look like this , but the police is one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bee colony . &quot;
&quot; to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which should also be torn down soon , it is already built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new lease apartments will be created . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , in recent weeks , however , preferred with burning cars is illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin city of Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel has repeatedly spoken for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were cleared with 300 police officers , report@@ edly pat@@ rol the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves in late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who since 1999 lives in the Kie@@ z , and Jan@@ a * , who raised three children here , are above all gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising rent and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , seeking mostly police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior activ@@ ator and the police escal@@ ate between household occup@@ ants and their neighbors , does not seem to exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which even today compared to the rest of the city a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the borough has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive lin@@ ers from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents of GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them in designed pan@@ es or newly painted faç@@ ades , which have been cast with color @-@ bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make property damages , which tend to meet rather the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house for 17 years beside the controversial 94 , there is no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , are no longer in Riga anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to Riga &apos;s street - and stayed .
&quot; that is why it was also so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the clear@@ ness of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by scre@@ aming new buildings in former constructions , which displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well drunk &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I do absolutely not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone is never listening ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ iled bred horses . Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left @-@ hand scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who comes up should be aware of it - just like someone , who moves into a pub area , can complain badly about noise . &quot;
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee committee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for the integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on the spot . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee committee for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee support , administration , authorities and who else is still involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the van@@ ishing wo@@ ollen service that has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than on the other , targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force was chosen with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an inc@@ ess@@ ant wool mel@@ low . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is supporting honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the W@@ as@@ strasse
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Federal Coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t work so far , if you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be constructed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent stay , there are intern@@ ships , training positions , school grounds , one @-@ euro @-@ Jobs and Au@@ xiliary activities for refugees and migrants who have to be ti@@ led or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very ti@@ dy , as reported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and client . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so , we need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , also here administration and volunteers ski@@ pping here . &quot;
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain to the refugees that it takes just and you can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever creates the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems too , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client quite clearly , &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve may call &quot; . &quot; however , a residual risk can and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks would bring them completely away .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look for activities on the spot and in the region .
&quot; in doing so , they have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
&quot; Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy , to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
fun@@ nel : Crus@@ her with helicop@@ ters
