<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">"for the 58 year old, it was a premiere."</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebrations, they hunted home for the feeding troughs in a quick gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," "says Langer."</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had to lead his family to the ALRV site, on a horse he didn't even catch himself for a photo."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of honours to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"national Cross, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means very much to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social engagement."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer promotes young talent."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the retire Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum of the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and mumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing trade agreements TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential candidates, however, are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively repatriate regulations, and it will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says," The state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes would increase for the rich, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in that must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, party-internal discussions could be given."</seg>
<seg id="17">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris Climate Convention.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand and demand the Renewable Energies with its investment program:" a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, don't want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"these should be paid even better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage does not have to be changed, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, at least asking for the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the division manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid programmes in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are aviaries.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women Help Centre."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - neither as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopes for hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the flight:" "many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs for example ask for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who think that the end, as soon as she holds in Germany, irritates, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and misused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experienced, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often fail to help, there need more accommodations only for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question, whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in housing of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabians alone, escaped women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Unter- und Mittelfranken there are storeys or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are housed separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need for protection, one can read the urge to go to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance specialists have called on their union to approve new labour campaign activities in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for the whole Council to approve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract that has been agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" "persistent quietly" "to problems, which led the contract to be rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating working activities that begins at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes resulted in the fact that assistants of this year were striking six times, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA resident physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed allied and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan might have behaved like never had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"building up again becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan had profited his own family from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been given up close to his office last month, with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late Imperial onslaught in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television would approve fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti described it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, as it was in response to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge over the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pired to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d'état in favour of the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit at this glittering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray one as an analyst once described," Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that have been breached and treated badly from the West and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peace-makers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents at the press conference said that they didn't even take the subject again."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey denied it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey flowed the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"he shared the BBC Scotland with:" the RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand, among which our employees will be busy, as we are now becoming a bank of brands. "</seg>

<seg id="16">"I now say that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">"each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work among these brands with the customers."</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to move to the Bank of the Marches, as how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "said the Chief Executive Officer."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born 1972 in Tallinn's Estonian capital, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it means (in Russian) that he later was the head of the protocol and the staff of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it's the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state, in terms of bill of law and controls to implement your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant, working as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man who once was praised as a potential President, suddenly would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said" it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once, it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term of office would have violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, approaching ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four locks of the" "ceiling blower", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slashes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Keith Brown's economic minister took a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when constructing the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viadukt and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the decks today gets a concrete casting for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the expansion of the northern tower, we had to close the gap to the north or south side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards when incline of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig-cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors should be taken much more seriously in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD will propose a "action concept living" at the next Council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D vice-president Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all the apartments available as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the low-priced apartments can also arise in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the main point in the town hall is, as Bratmann says:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to grow at least 10 percent in such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the flats are built as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction programme, which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed, is to provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" there is no agreement at the moment between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, as violist, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely new: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do we compare the loss of other around 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought borrowing from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into price fixing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one blow, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western city, at the end of the year, deadlines run out."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be brought back to price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, it is removed from the goal of the so-called interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said Group president Holger Herlitschke:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must enter into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokemon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and last to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder, and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the cell phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"cardio, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people running 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to bring" "30 minutes time", "" "come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people who look elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also mumeric players who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to play sports as it does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles turnt at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and total the fifth, while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected her last review in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has no longer lost a competition competition, a series of winners that will last as long as it wishes."</seg>

<seg id="27">Bribe beams and floor urns - in which Biles holds the title of the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed with 15.433 on the Swedish bar again - and sat on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her encampment - a pure form of formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake on Mustafina continued."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, called Oma, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her ground exercise she kicked down the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot, who have been killed in one of the deadliest attacks in the first series of killings of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a robbery overfeit, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 which were owned by one of the adult victims."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in total, seven people were killed in Hispanian residential areas within four months and two others were injured."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is believed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissin from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympic leadership and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Katholikin, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did unexpected, but masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americans who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but so gymnasium classes don't look like in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to bring it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks so that gymnasts are a more expensive sport and gymnastics are primarily used in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents responsible for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnclubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Gymnastics get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnast."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the communities aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access exercise training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we have offered free and affordable prices in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by the Holes of the Olympic Team golds and thank you, so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Registrar, announced last night in a communication with:" "assistant doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will incur the current situation crisis and to treat all doctors with justice."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correct culture boosts voters in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correcness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as a crushing government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles intervenes verbally the police, election observers and Rathaugers to have ignored evidence of electoral abuses due to" hypersensitivity in regard to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now a antagonist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tape outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">It is recommended that voters should have an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger, when they submit their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He urges that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial betg culture associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the reigning mayor Lutfor Rahman should be enthralled after a litany of corrupted and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "cynical way" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and anti-Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis, that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation, in which a person chooses to be someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarming to the fraudulent choice of letters - if the older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including guiding principles to prove their identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it states:" "evidence was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the older, especially communities with pakistanic or Bangladeshi backgrounds."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit correspondence documents to stop" "elective harvest". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social distress."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on the finger of a person, as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists deal with full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set off barriers for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law that facilitated an accusation due to intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (National Authorities Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography ban in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the elective stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of training, to ensure that employees prevail the rule that voters go alone into the elective cabin."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no penalty."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the court appealed to Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "Abhakcontrols" "of the electorate-registration departments of the Town Houses."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covered dispersion of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="3">"in order to worsen the situation, she looked at them as she looked at it, and put her back into the shelf again."</seg>
<seg id="4">They continued and tasted four pairs of underpants in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Primark shop in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear she went back and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the tray, pulled out her own tights and pants and tasted her."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone was staring when she withdrew the trousers, which you obviously did not like, as she put her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same with three other subhosen, before she finally decided that she didn't fall back and went out."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot line, "" says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright cheats his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and thrower to a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abused his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a singe button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to light."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to leak the rinse button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he spotted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate unique and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to dishwashing knobs of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to leak after their Luminometer Range was over 4000 units, while newly-washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacterial count at different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That comes to the worst thing I did in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not stop here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added:" let me tell you that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I instructed him, just like the eclectic Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to leak it and others where it was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had flaxed holes, wooden boards were torn, rubbish was spread on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror, which had joined the family, consisted of street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood floorboards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be invoked regularly by the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing Delogated her and her partners this week forcibly by the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation were cheered by relieved neighbors who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They weren't afraid of anyone. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always terrible.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally away, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogation is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be awful.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give consolation to some neighbours and conveys the message that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">"a dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground"</seg>
<seg id="33">"workers of the house administration will now have to throw garbage mountains, which surround the house"</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found about 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skeldon received a fine, after having found himself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial custody."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money for a grave of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 at a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delogate renters who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police shared that the Delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behavior," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer to Kenya."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately establish a disciplinary mission in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary told that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team management Kenias from the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the IAAF World Association has searched the IOC for information about the case in order to make their own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson shared."</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment," it was said in an IAAF declaration. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and acted as Ferguson Roti, released and signed the sample," "stated Kenias President de Mission Stephan Arap Soi."</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-Dialog Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany reckons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even be" "several hundred thousand", "believes the president Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard advance of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"at short notice I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government already passed Kurdish strongholds with penalties ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the putsch putsch, there are still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Verbandschef defed the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"thus, Erdogan wants to increase the travel pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Chief of the Federation demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, a" witch-hunt "is held against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last few months, I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not fit and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and Säkularen," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on appeal to numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum rights recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid than so far, it's not: summer holidays, heat and land fighting - that is biting."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the electors are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most tourists who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up voices are just laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the Feria, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must once again let their election campaign go over to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is how strongly newcoming AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of coalition-ducks."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one sees from his large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chat a little with the people, as it also did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and Angela Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooms of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create it, "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him probably the most beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its nickname candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale protests. Merkel's German parliament is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the North-East-CDU largely eliminates the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that said, Kokert, only plays an" "subordinate role". ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that, on the country, you are brushing the base that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely there in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electoral battalion Kokert, however, is self-exposing:" "you must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should create the leap into the land day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the vacation-need and spend their election campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign", "it calls the president Claudia Müller."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green electoral champions go to search for native voters among the holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, curvt just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am in the morning and end at about 8pm, there are no praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty crisp," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated southwards to the south at the start of the year, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"praise will also be the opposite of those responsible for building work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of heating systems."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and the barrier of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomforts," says the deputy chief executive director Florian King for the technical management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creep paths were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were confused.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits did not meet, the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant surges," says King, who himself made himself able to know himself about the situation. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been blown.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the road with 77 hours of hour in the pace-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 renovation has led to sales growth in them, everyone can look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some more and some are less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer" "are produced for other companies, for which the refurbishment hardly has consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership of Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" maximum slight decline, "but also admits that of course," the running documentary is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily-captured are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, the sales revenue is based on" far more than 50 percent. ""</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner whether there would be a financial compensation, otherwise the host profited from the advantages of the situation on the B. 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other districts where such a lot has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will pass on."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, he refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it's also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"that his stem cells come back again after the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history."</seg>

<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," "says the CDU man."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers this reasonable and also demanding nothing that does not have any chances at the co-operation partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by Maizière.</seg>

<seg id="21">"refugees who are picked up specifically into the country should check their smartphones in advance, and reveal social media accounts for a safety check."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Dulations for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also seem uneven and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient ones, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to conclude that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about the high number of refugees concerned about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that were deeply involved in people, were not allowed to complain about in election times too."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>

<seg id="36">"in the past few days, the two parties went up high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a gardener argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, where the Ressort-chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a reversal from the dual citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="2">Loving middle aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comments section, to overload it under the pseudonym of non-alloteric backgrounds with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely female group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers do not retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit, and I'm gazing wildly before I'm standing, holding my hands and deciding on something like that:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho slowly enters its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men middle-aged) into Reckless Records (data count: eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford when it appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and plunged."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are seeing themselves buying their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have to get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record-revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves, from objects that awaken happy itching memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the colt of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" a staff of a record stack flutes.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, haven't heard them yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I leafy through a pile of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," "I do not own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-like, less music-like."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stop, which has devoted the record to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I'm walking."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizer and sexbepacked pop, instead of experimental jazz drones out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but nagging mental traumas are hard to imagine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to make a shopping spree than a shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collection of records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to show the jeans-pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the strolling through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through panels, while they avoid the starry view of an uncanny, 30-year-old Moderator, who rises above the shoulders none of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be fuelled to sell 72 temporary businesses in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanitation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in addition, the provisional business and restaurants often offered accommodation and free meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is futile operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as providing advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure was" for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two help organisations help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants cherished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals in the course of the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at the 7-day Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji shared a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on it in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it is probably not - that at least a brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, they lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lose only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wondering and let the attacks jump out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau rushed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a temporary Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Breatho Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB was still seeded."</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB brought fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through a brilliant mid-play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favor of the South Sea sulpans whose fans swung flags, swung flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotive gold in these games and that's what you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rowing to the last 220 hard Hieve, which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they ruined the second Olympic champion in the second without a control woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, which laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.3 unlimited use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athlets that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each of the gold in the rowing, there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental progress that make the difference and it was no more an ordinary coach, who would survive 30 months ago when diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the correct term under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking morning with it more than ever talking and trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" I was an emotional wreck this week. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even over the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, panning and glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let oneself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about the future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to understand that I'm an Olympic Champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-exploited and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that were threatened by the industry from green electricity extraction are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the German steel industry, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition) remains in the liberation of the renewable energy supply in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm really happy that we finally managed to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks, an EEG overlay is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" steel is future, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment objectives are weighed down," said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation became more aggravated when the world's largest producer of growers threw steel on the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers introduce price dumping Chinese steel corporations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand imposed import duties on import steel have effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have been eroded."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price-collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"finally, ThyssenKrupp did not want to close the closing of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, some 860,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the economic unification reported steel on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short upliftment in May, the finished quantity went back to the second month after a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has grown by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good with her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"due to the regular assembly, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also taken Ursel Kipp in her choir," "Creating and organizing herself to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in a positive sense," "says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs become not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Citizens Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs by older people awakens a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia sufferers are sinking to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings of the circle of acquaintances in a senselor's choir, you can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, traitors Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - this is true for any age.</seg>

<seg id="7">"at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on Friday morning, two explosive rates were raised, while another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves with possible motives - but probably it is, however, about the deeds of the Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurrection movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage restricted to restricted areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the authorities would have kept secret evidence on imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they were not informed of the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is still unclear, which group is behind the attacks."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police ran their officials across the country to strengthen security around important governmental buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but most of them are not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>

<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to steal chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, retained itself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military has not managed to get a grip on the insurrectionary rebellion of the Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympionics or world records determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV images."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in subrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as in Ethiopia, most sportsmen run, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames started the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media marked him as "Robel of Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "prosperity bump", "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "was funny about him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he first beat a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of freestyle, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to face a 100-metre free-style ride alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim before Olympia only eight months before the competition and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to sign an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions were allowed on the ground, an investigative committee of the Congress held in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Defence Committee, reports of great discontent under Central Command's secret services analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically mailed by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it had allowed actual states on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, noted. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The management error in Centcom reaches up to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct indication that government tips under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superiors to sign an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom affiliated publicly announced that a military re-conquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Member of Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the peak of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force into life after being admitted to them, that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence services on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, such as Mr. Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports," the morality of analysts said and "gave excessive space for dissenting opinions." "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon chief inspector, which were recorded after complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress's reports while investigating the General Inspectorate is still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful campaign of air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that has since been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's allegations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writer about how the former government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq, and a little time went on to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team around Mr. Hooker insists that contrary to the government statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature on account of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, this is true: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britches on the first place, which will remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutch a little longer to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind due to their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time a Hockeyslayer in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadres."</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working capital in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is handed over from the wristband to the gymnast to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecker or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could well have been among these known names that would be sent to the Prime Time, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline turne."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastplate and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived as sparsely the last 16 years that many people I had asked, didn't know that it is an Olympic portal at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping, and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has some outsider charms, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earnest enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, which combines two kinds of sports."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hencing and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic Committee, they are evaluated according to performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists have to go to gold in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes go and back, upwards and downwards at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the finish line or the baseline, but also another higher goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympias."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as something tiring when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a breathing break."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the spruce and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expected his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia, push for violent resistance to the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and turned into ever more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people attacked the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the response of the government was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Commission now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations continued oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden that have been defeated in the past few years or were forced to use turmoil and re-arming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of falling under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improved internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were so much assembled.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, mainly come to Christian high-countries, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes exactly.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemeku, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is inwardly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigers who constitute about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special mandates to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailamariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam came from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections that were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the past months and that time of unrest went by relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misappropriation of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharish city, conducted by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently reported that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this", "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin ridge."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump states his statement Obama has been based on ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump attempted to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensible to the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings its comrades, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase of protection, in the peculiar position to explain the statements he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was referring to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism depends on Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand values."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton thought about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language boundaries in politics and then rowing as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "according to how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump accepted an even more corrosive tone, as his survey values continued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accused his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensified in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal colleagues into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocally his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, was struggling to defend candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have formed the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backwarers, completely wrong, and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread it aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he scorned the" poor, unfortunate "television experts trying to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Reverie's apology than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that the ingredient stretches.</seg>

<seg id="17">COE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "shows the ways in which the country was going to be no longer the country of arms."</seg>

<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was also tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseries became staple foods, the casserolle as" "wonderful way to recycle food residues," "noted Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried out, because a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haarks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie comes up with up to 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland shark floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it depends on it, the five meter long animal accelerates at a full speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland haarks are stone age."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haarks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea from the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland haarks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion measures they as they equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this shark: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver who torch from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland haarks who took fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen from Greenland or Spitzbergen as a bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were notably carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the liner core, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in their lenses, all larger Greenland haarks had normal carbon-14 quantities, which originates through cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-watch showed a 493-centimeter long Greenland-shark at the age of 335 years, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females get offspring first, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haarks with propagation obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flames."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner's last evening in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy himself. the Jump made the legend very proud when he stormed home to win a win from the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after taking place in March at the World Championships in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as an executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in which they stayed, when they saw the potential in the ballast that has now developed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner competed in qualifying rounds, but in the standarround, the New Zealand won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he was short, but Kenny took the team to the front and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategy change made a major part of the transformation, when executing it in a higher gear, to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an Olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 at the site Kennys and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell onto the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem for this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like London's flags at the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (an apparently sacred date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which will start today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometer racing."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he was contested with commissioners before the qualification, when functionaries were calling him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in Worldrecord time at 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a band to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama in the background, as well as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and mopeds as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if you see the first evening of competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of the GBs, which has reached its climax for the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are standing in the game, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominoes, as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, shared the fact that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" hedging businesses, "which should have entered into force from November 2016 onwards."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared the value of the contracts already written in his annual subscription to $187 million in "expectation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is yet another explanation, why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity every year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, it would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite messy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, that would suffice today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came into business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"however, 20 years ago the communicator was a sensation."</seg>

<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>

<seg id="3">"for me, it was the biggest attraction Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies in the vicinity of Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new jobs alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamend on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole of the UK."</seg>

<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably was once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have shown similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly resumed."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth, but once there had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as her hydrogene withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back down with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware protection specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the solutions demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful, the potential to deliver ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of pollutants," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks happened in the past few months frightening fast."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as word-, Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the reported German companies reported revenue losses caused by Ransomware, 13 percent had to break the business completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute by the loss of sicknesses."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims:" "don't pay, you only promote the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, direct access to accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more probable that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their pollutants in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware-Kits have been created by the malware itself, Consulting and additional Tools purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around for hours, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you don't have to think about sleep much more in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people feel as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially during a depression," "says Weeder."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a disk failure can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder over everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look different: one is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleep mediator in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleep problems one should first turn to the GP, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to the sleeping laboratory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise for example in snoring with breathing exercises, in case of disease fatigue, for insomnia or if one does not find the cause of a drowsy disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a midday sleep," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cracking, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera at the ceiling distinguishes sleep-ends."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of bolts on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"there is no need to sleep, don't watch TV for falling asleep, don't watch TV for falling asleep, stopping drinking alcohol and not at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that's quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, in recent weeks, however, preferred with burning cars is illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin city of Innensenator Henkel has repeatedly spoken for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, reportedly patrol the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from the cheers of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in late late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who since 1999 lives in the Kiez, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are above all generalized by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rent and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, seeking mostly police protection from the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior activator and the police escalate between household occupants and their neighbors, does not seem to exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which even today compared to the rest of the city a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the borough has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elective liners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents of GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in designed panes or newly painted façades, which have been cast with color-bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make property damages, which tend to meet rather the newbuilds and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house for 17 years beside the controversial 94, there is no question of uncertainty."</seg>

<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="13">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle is supporting honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon available in the Wasstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Councillor to the Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"it didn't work so far, if you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings must be constructed as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training positions, school grounds, one-euro-Jobs and Auxiliary activities for refugees and migrants who have to be tiled or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that's motivated and very tidy, as reported by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and client."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, also here administration and volunteers skipping here."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central, that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain to the refugees that it takes just and you can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever creates the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems too, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and Customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do they have fear of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Client quite clearly, "what some naïve may call". "however, a residual risk can and may not exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks would bring them completely away.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbach are already busy, to integrate the previous people sensibly."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
