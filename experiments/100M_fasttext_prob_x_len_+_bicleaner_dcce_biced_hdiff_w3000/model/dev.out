Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to speak about the implementation of international agreement , as well as T@@ eher@@ an destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the encounter , there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been excited for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel , and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had kept a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not allowed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend shot shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon said with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that had ever loved me , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that , who travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , where he was shot a popular history of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Delta State University , Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , when the police took him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what was motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investigations on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students said that they rejo@@ iced in his lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he said , he has no history of violence or criminal history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned his book in one of his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he shared his acute life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who said , he seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously , the Delta State University had asked for a evidence of health reasons , and said that he had some health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the University was significant that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked hard for him , no guarantee for an automatic way to an order as a Assistant professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told nothing of a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are questions , which cannot answer any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car was still in the entrance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , the Lamb grew up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and under@@ took ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he graduated in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they and their friends were in the high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to join the guitar game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was at the time of women &apos;s black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls are mol@@ ten when he was there , H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the Back@@ stone house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said , they were killed 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter that was now 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een , he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail began three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , they played the one or another G@@ ig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes , and sings her own music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had ended his guitar and mou@@ th@@ ss Night in the night 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no signs that anything was not agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were together with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of she@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the t@@ ote Professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American local residents and colonial history , Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , a English professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Brotherhood and students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took about 900 people , including lecturer , staff , students , students and members of the church at a candle light celebration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Schmidt and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the University Hospital &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lessons will be taken back on Wednesday , on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ beloved o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi and Re@@ bec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story has been corrected to contradic@@ t the police , that the police had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever got married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set less workers for Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Toys R Us says that it is not so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give up a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it will cover 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 4@@ 5.000 workers were set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be partial jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it will start in this month with application talks , and the number of employees from October to December is rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the holidays even months , the Christmas business is closer , and companies prepare themselves to equip shops with employees to sell shops and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox , over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat at the theatre , and I know that the seat is empty next to me , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated fork and a diameter length of it , with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to Time &quot; , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer St@@ even Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had a premiere at 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really true for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ous of the biggest time trip film that has ever been filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says , his answer to Russia reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN boss again calls all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday , that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the pres@@ ets in the Council and within the Syrian people , and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an requested the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which have proven the same solidarity with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 conversion values that demonstrate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans attempt to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper rings at the bottom , it has not been working ( nor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is still too early in the electoral period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts emphasize that at this time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was submitted to the rising Her@@ man Cain , which won &apos;t have a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but outside groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps throughput and start their dollars to overthrow him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some current demand values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 180 degrees , Tr@@ um@@ ps is turned around 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump was announced in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until mid @-@ July , there were 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these figures are in early states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be angry , if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be enthusiastic about 40 percent that would say the same above Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abli@@ shment , the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament , not as a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Donald Tr@@ ump , the real temper@@ ament of the Republi@@ cans believe that the real temper@@ ament for a President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ selection state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a upper defect , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to be effective and almost six of 10 independence say that his temper@@ ament did not pass into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they set up their joints , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , tell a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time , as four of ten the ten end of July their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters had not been the most clear crystal ball in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ um@@ ps is a plau@@ sible campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still almost everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts indicate that the broken field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed over a dozen different candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the multi @-@ related support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally at the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have forgiven their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , a lot of course can happen to change that and nobody can really say , never change the opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 per cent said that they can open the door , to change to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition in the moment of the other outside , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they match with Tr@@ ump in the topic of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was named after two months of immigrants from Mexico , &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned , that the bom@@ b@@ tical expression of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the new @-@ oriented efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey from Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as the immigration in the ramp remains in the ramp , Donald Tr@@ ump will also do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ stration over the government climbs up to new levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , mainly due to its outside status . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also angry on Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential buildings in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , the most expensive residential community with view over the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , a square meter of a re @-@ walled building costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited in accordance with the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new study shows , in which particular locations a square meter is most cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top residential locations , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate service Angel@@ s Angel@@ ers has published a leader@@ board of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in vibr@@ ating heights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but well , who can afford it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top of the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
champ@@ ionships League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Te@@ e
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Pir@@ ate : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a happy hits of Thomas Müller made the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus , then ran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Müller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her tac@@ t@@ play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to garbage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and is suitable matches ( 8 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guided Mi@@ ght of Olympic ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ah Roberto , who had passed one as a flan@@ k of the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m was promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed a concentrated and committed idea , without shine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pir@@ ate had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including the famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went brave , with their obvious efforts , but often too late to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often caused by playing storage on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed by the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller had more happiness , when his flan@@ k struck from the right half field in the left upper gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as Olympic ak@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head of the Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by directors , the Tor@@ ah Roberto with the knees ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the Bavaria moved to the usual dominant game , pir@@ ate needle could be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te wings ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Neu@@ er , we defend a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Jes@@ e , after muscular problems back in Ka@@ der , sat outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and took 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still sat down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the game , it was come to Kra@@ w@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a small group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block , the followers of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus revealed the safety forces and went out with percussion against the Munich trailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least a Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ ked , has a higher risk to lose teeth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are smo@@ ked , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this is a Pots@@ dam@@ er long term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good news , if the risk is reduced quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - up to 3.@@ 6 @-@ Fa@@ che higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main causes for tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and tooth loss will therefore go back to more frequent denti@@ stry and smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to be clari@@ fied , unless smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard with smoking , could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the risk of non @-@ smoking sin@@ ke , declared first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man must convince people of this , non @-@ smoking , declared study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not too smoke is good for lungs and vessels , and leads to good dental health to high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population are affected by the age of 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lined the findings .
archae@@ ologists come to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on the rem@@ nants of the spi@@ der antique
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the repeated time , the Rhein@@ u@@ fer has been made in Cologne archaeological findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ eton and remains of historic buildings , museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn as a specialist office for archae@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists were now five . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the rest of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs have been discovered , who belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman from freight train
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman at the station at the train station , the Federal Police asks for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the railway station and was recorded by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the recording of the access , she has carried the most severe injuries according to federal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was treated in a hospital on site , treated with rescue workers in a hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the reason of the noc@@ tur@@ nal track crosses the young woman , there are no findings in the middle of the young woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses , or residents of acoustic percep@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in question , residents or Pass@@ es of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , brick pools , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the cause of the accident , can be placed at around the clock and free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private parking facilities for disputes between concert and states should therefore be solved by a transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens &quot; says the responsible EU Commissioner C@@ eci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the United States , the sul@@ din has to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by TT@@ IP , the largest free trade zone of the world with 800 million people are created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shall come to the same parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow it to rise against urine parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the proceedings involved in the arbit@@ rators involved in the arbit@@ ration of arbit@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , citizens have become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration dishes are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , on the basis of compensation for tax@@ pa@@ yers and to reduce national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act took the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it was particularly critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great progress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission on reform essential points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trading ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the European corporate association business Europe , the European Business Association of Business Europe had to limit the economy of economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly small and medium sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks about the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday , on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic of investment protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement already should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as no more durable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of eleven years , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , which has recorded the picturesque U.S. State Mich@@ ig@@ an with fil@@ esystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells of various places that he always shows on the map , what about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they were created , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs , which can be harmonious very close to American folk music in late six@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ ours , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ plated series : each of the 50 US states should be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year later , the musician returns to the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

superior to ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album is rising in the American Bill@@ board charts , and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens operated on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic publishers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , however , by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago the smaller clubs , the stage shows are the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although here almost 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the clearly rei@@ fer will return back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw the &quot; plate &quot; basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in addition to an addition , St@@ ev@@ ens would like modest , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and tends to be under Tuscan applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut in the prime minister of the prime minister is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut in the prime minister of Prime Minister , and for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , whereby its performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he could skip some meetings , to leave her colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow of the shadow and after his speech on the TU@@ C annual meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Chairman , on Tuesday during the sin@@ king of the National Park of a memorial to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several titles stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not the nation@@ als to sing , has drawn attention to themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the aviation to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow wireless , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Council to sing the National an@@ ne , &quot; regardless of his faith that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ atures have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leading team , and they called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be stack@@ able within Labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , the TU@@ C Conference said that Labour changes pre@@ tend to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow work and rati@@ fied minister said that the party was very clear that it is only opposed to the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , which David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour Chairman , who promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron , and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the questionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister is committed , and that he is able to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow host minister in him will be represented when he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron is on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he gave John Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ says to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was born in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is linked to the politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watch theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it was sent first in 1990 in 1990 , the questionn@@ aires was considered to be the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and its leadership in the sub@@ house and its position under his parliamentary committee , although critics have become a car@@ ic@@ ature , and have far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound rose up to data that show a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the building target SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , the result was without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2,@@ 9 % compared to the same previous year period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and tested assessments on the time of a interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound rose more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % , after the tak@@ eover offer of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world , and brands such as Bud@@ wise , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bur@@ berry shares were after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0,@@ 9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures propose all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry and growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining ri@@ ese , that it was 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper concerts of the Mon@@ di were the largest verses on the index , and with a decline in 4.@@ 3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had its assessment for the company R@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after a pre @-@ tax result of a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; can mean more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will be the higher labour costs with its company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and this could mean that there is less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Pol@@ es sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bi@@ eber construction : here you can hang I@@ dol , whose posters are hanging on St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as their Mama E@@ wa deserves half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wik@@ tori@@ a had to sit in the tenth class in the Gymnasium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you are looking at the window disc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 100 million , he should be exploited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some say that hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA and Britain with its new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album will follow in November , are not interested in the many nuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he is doing so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings me to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes both - and in the potato , he developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ bis@@ s@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato has put potatoes and meat together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wording &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly in television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , in his shop there is a barbe@@ cu@@ le that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Lebanese project has now been present in the patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to information of the authority , she has been protected as a utility pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a lot of meat and as much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as much : &quot; it tastes better , &quot; he finds it better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with its customers , culinary international understanding is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis starts ground @-@ sign campaign for comb@@ ating algae - diarr@@ hea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met@@ amor@@ tization tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di exit in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are preparing their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand by mainstream media and marketing about social media , as well as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough distributed in I@@ GA stores samples and shop owners who sell tickets for the South Australian football li@@ ga to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that metap@@ hysi@@ cal details will be published on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler distributor for food , alcohol and devices will lead to its annual investors strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA shop business and generate higher profit margin than Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purchases in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away from all existing actors , but mainly independent single @-@ standing sales sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley , that I@@ GA @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million revenues per year and Met@@ amor@@ ath will lose 250 million $ to the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up to 25 Fili@@ alen in SA and 30 in WA , and will achieve a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in food and food business and the quantities of met@@ cas@@ hs high fixing base could cost savings around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , metap@@ hysi@@ cal market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently guided survey of Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the tre@@ ach@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley particip@@ ates in sales and grocery store by 3.@@ 8 percent in the year 2016 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in Melbourne , that metap@@ hysi@@ cs probably will disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has taken contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trading , which reflects about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail@@ er since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the wholes@@ aler distributor , however , inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , to improve sales trip with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ es with hundreds of products every week and deliver better selection of private label foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prices will be expected to return to El@@ an for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 , for the first time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the President of the Australian tennis , Steve He@@ aly is supported by President of the Australian tennis courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
congratulations asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserve more praise as criticism for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than@@ than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; Koll@@ ater@@ al@@ damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; was marked with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka in the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to beat twice by the arbit@@ ration , and I should beat the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last time he was seen as a tennis ra@@ cket , a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas quet was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in Ein@@ zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I was quite beautiful , the fact that after my opinion , asi was a little in the dispute , said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know the asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , it &apos;s extremely good in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around , and I believe that he was a little too strict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very rei@@ fer 19 year old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves to be assessed according to his own services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gios does not take into account the decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone but he assures to return the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm part to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is concentrated on the competition , and not all the controversy around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe that Nick has done very quickly to Ascension , but we try to support him the consequences of his actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency level , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the emergency level and led the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the firm who tried to stop illegal in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and the Serbian officials re@@ acted with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who fled from violence were st@@ acked for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and assembled tents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ stration rose up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police officer on them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of protest foods and water back , some reported from protest food and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , and not a collaboration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ences at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 4@@ 0.000 people who would finally find out a agreement that the EU states would be more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary , however , did not put his hopes to a bal@@ er action from Brussels or from his neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency level in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they were able to unlock roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also has finished the construction of a thorn @-@ wiring along its border to Romania , to stop the stream of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison students in the race , the thorn @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few months , Hungary has become a considerable difference in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , passed on it that most of the upcoming economic fle@@ ets have been looking for protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary , making the government along the southern border to Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that originated by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said Government Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already tag@@ el@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people had to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already deep into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come about by damage the fence , they are now in police force and are accused of crimes after the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , authorities are to repair the fence quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border transitions with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ racks to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos has opened the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of man and pressed a crowd around there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 20 , there were about 20 , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they are travelling to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former U.S. Foreign Minister H@@ illary Clinton continues to win a two @-@ digit growth in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination on national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders at the second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced that he receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Clin@@ ton supporters are in their choice , as the other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey Clinton has lost Clinton in a series of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton holds a great advantage for women and mixtures , but these precau@@ tions have decreased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your support for men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ics benefit from democratic voters under 50 years , and they are now on the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage for older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month Clinton was talking about two @-@ digit growth in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage at this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections , they would say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm Clinton if they would be nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions and further 15 percent , they would only support them because they are the Canary Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six percent would not support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s current supporters are mainly impressed by her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about one quarter , it would be enthusiastic about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say that Clinton will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say fewer republi@@ can voters say about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Clin@@ ton supporters are asked in an open question , why they want the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best can@@ oes for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Clin@@ ton Sup@@ ports , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and voters are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the vice @-@ president is a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ shell , 57 percent of democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be the second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Clin@@ ton followers , more than half that Bi@@ den would be far from the second choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Bi@@ den does not decide for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clin@@ t has increased from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race at 30 points without it in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as can@@ oes , with the best opportunities to win the choice ; however , this number of 78 percent decreased in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is a second at this measurement , but the percentage that it looks like the &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters are unacceptable as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in voters of the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi@@ tudes consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and trusted with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den cuts the best way for hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Clinton &apos;s democratic voters see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are questions about H@@ illary Clin@@ t , using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the official minister , most demo@@ cra@@ cies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the half of the Americans is un@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy did not have effects on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 , say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 per cent of the election , they do not hold for an honest and trusted person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the election nationwide is also not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good notes on leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best for hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the elections is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son continues to go back to Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; republi@@ can voters support nationwide Tr@@ ump in large number . the support grows by 23 % in recent C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate on Tuesday 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ son , in the same period of 6 % to 23 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also showed that Car@@ son is good for demographic groups , and tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is in the lowest month , and of 10 % support in the last month are now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % on the third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey , Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , the last week has been published , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he has been supporting 19 % support at the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some lateral hi@@ ring for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son , Tr@@ um@@ ps took faith in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaigns in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if top values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bathroom in northern or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people don &apos;t go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , the Mediterranean still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it comes even up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly two years , after a student during a schi@@ kan@@ ous ritual as a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ ers are submitted against five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood , Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory step in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , while he tried to go over a frozen field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g did not know about head@@ aches , then he fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was mighty and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they had the time to contact D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ ls began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood basically about Michael Den@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a Aut@@ op@@ si@@ e@@ report , Den@@ g was repeated with silent power injuries to head , hull and thi@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies at least a student since 1970 , Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a County Grand jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e received an indictment for the first five members , for the first five members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are accused of a criminal union because of a criminal union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that has been officially or in@@ officially - this is officially announced , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a interest rate comes , and the house will get into the wound , and the economy will rise for bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know how long it will last , and how long it will keep it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate , and lasted 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial systems react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank thus stressed that investors should not concentrate on it when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the end , market participants might notice that the whole excitement could be exagger@@ ated because of an interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to fear the sil@@ ky shock that seem to fear many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a historical trends based on historical trends , such as some areas of economy could react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the precau@@ tions can do things for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study that has happened after the interest of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 35 days , the market is estimated in the last 35 days , with an average yield of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , CEO facility strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares were later in the increase cycle , and the return of return begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ u@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases it often . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which did not have before and the recession could accelerate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , since 1950 , the German Bank was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few that will continue and expect the third quarter according to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest in such a question@@ able economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have made the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strategy and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade only gives a chance of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increased cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum took place and before @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ate very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession was observed in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is far from the longest , which has been waiting for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is up to 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fixed income was also volatile , since the market takes a interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster is faster than at shares , when its strategic course change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the increased cycle , the bond was immediately removed , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strategy of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer and shorter bonds , and lead to a spac@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analysts at Sch@@ wa@@ b said , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ stin at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the view of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the tragic curve has increased and the Vol@@ ati@@ tude has increased - all features of the market , when the F@@ ed has increased its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole company , companies that benefit from the larger part of their business activities in the USA , benefit if interest rates increase and local products are more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debts are worse , as a rising dollar makes its products more expensive and the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares tend to react to three months after a initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with strong balance sheet companies have exceeded companies with weak balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average of 5 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with high capital markets , as well as low Vol@@ ati@@ arity in their shares , also met their pend@@ ants with low quality at the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
debts are a great problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest , Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock exchange , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings could see profits by higher income , even if experts are different opinion , how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he argued that he is not different to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also told the BBC Music Awards , and said that she was im@@ planted only The Br@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle the broadcast The Voice and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary link and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private sender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives MEP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station , and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to transform Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started in previous year , The Br@@ its seem to be under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC General Director showed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I can learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ sur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of radio 3 , new music can be found and new works in order to give up new works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to engage the audience , as it did this in the past because the British have been informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports under fire , for commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall consisted of that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes to find that the company can find a hit from our house in our house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to exclude the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the Internet sales rose at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the lowest result was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that the Black Friday , in November , has increased expenses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual entry has been dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have changed in Gei@@ ster@@ cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , experts say that it is now signs that the online turnover will show that new figures were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales ended , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look forward to the growth rates for the years and continue to return to 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales designation of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales was reinforced before three years ago , as buyers began to make purchases of purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could buy online , and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now the one , and we will be able to experience that growth is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for subsequent revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of cavi@@ ties around their computers to make their car@@ eers , and some dealer websites fell off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could refuse to keep buyers of it , buyers could make purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study of British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that from 5 £ spending a bit more than 1 £ online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out over Web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is s@@ ank@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse partly of the huge Sau@@ dic Bin Laden group to load
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to be buried , were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trauma filled , largely dressed in white , the route to z@@ apping their respect , when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries passed over to the Holy Place , where only days before a building on the ceiling of the mos@@ que , and then fell on the bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , as the Saudi @-@ king over the construction companies of the family Bin Laden for the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 the last left , a sanc@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ ers , who were killed as a crane by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to his first pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch , in the Great Mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia already told that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man said the bin Laden group would not stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company is forbidden to travel abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man caused the overthrow of the crane caused by hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden group did not have any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal decree , also the group because of not current security measures , and because they do not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction process , which is led by the Bin Laden group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia since decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ rup@@ ter son who was un@@ suitable for the family in 1990 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the crane came in the middle of a strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is needed at least once in life of each healthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said that 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government representatives , that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the Get@@ ting are charged and the same sum is permanent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other publishers receive half of this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of the bil@@ l@@ ost@@ al European craftsmen is over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has rise behind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim to be opened on arti@@ sans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales offices nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City boss correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it claims that British , their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sent to a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to perform home jobs in their houses , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which can be set up to arti@@ sans and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said to deal with more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are made by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the men weigh the men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , it is necessary to represent the growing demographic trends that have more female single households more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this more to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a great role in decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also converted their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including his management and finance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her seduc@@ ed a decline in half @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year profit and the changes , after the group had the cost for closing the shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q features 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function of A@@ ich / D@@ ob , because of un@@ faithful judgment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice President , A@@ ich / D@@ ob must be responsible for un@@ faithful and abor@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them had been accused of official abuse , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , he has been acqu@@ itted in May right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ff@@ led , the accused had been cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the defend@@ ants were used in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts , which they were used in their functions for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports functional are also indic@@ ted due to financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact , the Chairman of the Sch@@ op@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Rich@@ mond Micha@@ ela San@@ in , made of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be made at a later date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , the sport function@@ aries would have been operating and invested in the sports club for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( RD . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have paid money , our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; said he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , it may only be made any debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in case of appropriate financial , the payout of withdrawal damage to 1991 has been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the wall units were only after years later , in 2003 , as a plus on the account was paid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the former Ob@@ mann seemed to explain the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and as@@ books put together the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association has not been revealed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial results , but only the debt of debt has been so important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association account in 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accused have been , declared the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known according to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the respon@@ dents knew no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happens to him , nobody knew something from this money , the prosec@@ utor presented in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , right of the function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this bank transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why damage ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the first defend@@ ant refused to agree with this formulation because the association never had a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary , he never had a c@@ ents content , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage money and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Di@@ ets , he added the Association 1,000 Euro per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exact documents for the early years , the defend@@ ants could not present the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are according to an operating test , in which everything was correct , no longer been kept , they declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the second accused also had the second defend@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of them are in cash , and he has to drive from his residence to the bank to the bank , he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stands for more than 30,000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , since three years of ongoing personnel reduction , the computer sc@@ esis will be disman@@ tled for further jobs for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) can be found at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the framework of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to expand the degradation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , costs in the amount of 2,@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , shared the company on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2,@@ 7 billion , which will be falling from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since three years , the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retro@@ spective gave the H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard share 2,@@ 3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is currently used in a new society , the computer and printing business with computer servers and data store for companies as well as the other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business parts should be recorded at the stock exchange .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25@@ ,@@ 4 billion dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the proceeds went back in 15 of 16 quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP answers to the changes in the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 years old companies under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted late to purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and always do more business online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers on combat hand in Iraq would be mainly on rejection : 54 percent talked about 35 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian police participated in the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , and waterfalls against several hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke down the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind the police , a police line was formed and ready behind the polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees began with stones , sho@@ cks and plastic bottles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of refugees , there was a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the group was dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have gone back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children who had entered the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees , together and s@@ led under breathing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the pres@@ et of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and pepper spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is observed when the US bank@@ bank comes to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for almost one decade , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , that the F@@ ed will do this , now that the F@@ ed will do something longer , and the interest rates will keep on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an historical event because it has seven years , since the F@@ ed interest in NU@@ LL has been set on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ BS , Lei@@ sure staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. economy is added to a relatively good performance , tri@@ cky dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warned the markets , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 am ME@@ Z on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the world &apos;s around 1,000 executives , the Group &apos;s Group will cost the workplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lufthansa builds its corporate structure , and evalu@@ ates the r@@ att@@ oo@@ ed Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a result of around 500 million euros per year from cost and soluble syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , there is no executive board for passenger business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new design , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was very complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight lines held under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , the three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new negotiations with pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be taken back on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of discussions , the meeting should be the place control for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast record result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , the conflict between union and air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots , the austerity concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like Lufthansa in the fight against competitive routes to the group &apos;s own billi@@ ards , Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; dawn in the south &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paintings of Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time in Göttingen , Finn@@ in has compiled a selection of a selection of tit@@ ular works which are animated by their viewer , thank@@ ful to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United , can &apos;t play months for double frac@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this left the left outer defense for the wines , Louis van Ga@@ al is not able to play the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a backward attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated nine minutes on the game field , and needed oxygen before he was brought into hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be transferred to tomorrow , or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the envelope , he had a oxygen mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , the six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a el@@ bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ ration , has not punished the Mexican . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al , that the Italian arbit@@ ration had p@@ aired themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to Gen@@ ital now , I come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , England Defender has an additional incentive to recover the upcoming June until the coming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves this type of injury the place , all of them are very sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg of leg , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels like it , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital , after a F@@ oul@@ der from Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , David Cameron The Lor@@ ax know better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless , you might be David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to call the Federal Minister for The Lor@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to give my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead , a content entry of the film version of 2012 will be added to extend the new characters and details to extend the quite short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the surrounding town of Th@@ ing @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see a real tree , his right name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if the text is not suspi@@ cious enough , the lyrics of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is unlikely to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action is so little familiar with the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ur@@ ly , snor@@ ing , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was presented to a helpers who read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times each one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Dow@@ ning Street speaker said that the text was probably came from Camer@@ ons election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ oon staff was delivered , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one has chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series not on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ure page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear a you@@ ths of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message is based on this message : Adam Ly@@ th fail from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are focused on results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that players are their own best expressions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he hopefully come out for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he had not so good services , and that is surprised me ; he is above all a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test drummer receives to set his sign is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Comp@@ ton got the chance to get home and backwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only way that you can rise , was that England was in the Caribbean first - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I highly recommend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be at least the same opportunities as before him , but this depends on the team of teams in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would give an extra spin Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer cannot beat there , and this link has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no great difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my previous team colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined 2001 as Open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made three hundred vines immediately , and looked back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spots that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the team , England made a few wise additions to the trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ an , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est candle of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour , and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in harmony with the before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ work will not determine the schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that as with players hang their jobs from the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not made easy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it warehouse ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Britain from the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u , if the economy is up to 2017 in a F@@ lau@@ te unit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ il@@ gor@@ ene real@@ ignment strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the guide of Labour or TU@@ C , which was crushed by Europe on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ats said that some member states , so deeply rooted in different crises , as the EU has now been created and not always made out of own guilt , Great Britain themselves created agenda with a pal@@ atable concessions and disturbing contractual changes that they usually do not want to be filled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that it does not like to end@@ anger the social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to go outside the Great Britain inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass tells us that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials come up to the point where it is no matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them , like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also a verbal force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland may soon have a national Rights government , Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are to break out a leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , to prevent the energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to have to be used because most similar statistics have to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may also be able to accelerate some such ministers , in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s record campaign 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the new trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Europeans know how to customs the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and what EU scep@@ tics can be inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all his backward , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Med@@ ley belonged to the taxes of taxes , phone h@@ ack@@ ers , phone h@@ ack@@ ers , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ countries who have most of our major newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , however , that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one sits better ban@@ anas to get rid of him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was rejected more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir himself , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the EU that was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has never missed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back - I told him that he seems to repeat no time for me - appears in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ t &apos;s strategy at the time and today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I don &apos;t think it is friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ e @-@ tendency and the wild valleys of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ England can probably say Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provoke John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow law was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me about the 70 @-@ years , as his old father said to be his old father in television , without going to go too far and lose his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , &quot; What J@@ C told his vote and MEPs after all reports on their clause on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the touched Bot@@ tom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and before all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct , Cameron does not allow for Europe who allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the speakers for self @-@ understanding how Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell told it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental multi@@ tudes to EU membership , its anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate under the left dis@@ integration , which is a central principle of do@@ gmati@@ sm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with his surplus value for NATO - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ fest is convinced that J@@ C will not be a campaign to Australia - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their pres@@ ets at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin political capital waste , they also have mis@@ c voters - to make concessions to the British , if this can be all sensual ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government at power , which was reminded by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England about E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , L@@ anc@@ et joined by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but some researchers have put the load capacity of the data , and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month , the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; on the P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J , and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expected that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to conduct a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants declared to receive means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he has received before the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , of which some also include a sector financing in paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he participated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no such connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director for Health and wellbeing at P@@ he , said that on the claims of BM@@ J already re@@ acts previously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life of life dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence is close to the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he has the clear duty to information about the public about what the proof and not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 8@@ 0.000 people die annually on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs two billion £ per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear reference of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC should give East@@ calendar , former boss says Channel 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that BBC should stop , programs such as East@@ calendar and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC to place publicly @-@ legal programs , which probably can be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmitter such as BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said , the company said to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years at Channel 4 without success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be done in order or sends , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ sub@@ stitutes Riv@@ als , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , what I do or long term not for a good idea , one should at least make its production at least on programs that do not make or in order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this , is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , covered both self @-@ productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am willing to see , as this is public @-@ right television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will work at the hunt for reviews , because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC shows his comments to the most popular Shows of BBC , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows such as East@@ calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather publicly legal niche programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should not measure , but they can argue , and they can argue that they have created all these ob@@ lation programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put them into a time window , where nobody wanted to see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the broadcast fee , Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , remember all that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who is true for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC should review their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to make and enter@@ tain them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would be classified as a education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the question of partnerships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , which he said that only a handful in television are shown , and with the commercial transmitter alli@@ ances to make everything online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they can be radi@@ ated with sound effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled out of sound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they have high frequencies for human hearing at high frequencies , to be radi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels to react to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IS@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impulses to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they did , when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bladder , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reinforced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these icons , and enable the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels carry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he uses ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and put into the worms where they turn into the changed mot@@ on@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with pulse of light to and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages compared to this technique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a s@@ warm of arms hanging with the D@@ LR ... customers will be asked to help at the stop of the ce@@ trade fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 300 posters are exhibited by artists , who have exhibited their work in the museum for cruel designs in bank sys D@@ ism@@ aland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ Pack of In@@ bus@@ keys , which claims to gain access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transportation for London finds this poster &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; not funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the par@@ o@@ dy ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists do with activists within protest movements to work , and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , that their art has a influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another of the anti @-@ traffi@@ cking posters greet the car in the subway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times over Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , the non @-@ profit @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artists , who also works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed about the silence , which was about the advertising for the arms fair - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising , but with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ k awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an introduc@@ tory of the British government and the guarantee that foli@@ age devices are not tra@@ ded in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order of the US army on &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a &quot; unique shaped vessel head , which provides outstanding performance effects in the interior of the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever it causes , it will not be pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eight golden rules for life in student residence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 11 years ago , I moved to Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the gra@@ ceful smile of those who have been angry - and to the numerous , slow complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of what I learned , can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance to student residence is enough of slightly ner@@ ven@@ ing , up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let people tell you where you are coming to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you don &apos;t love to hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and help others to do the same - ask questions , and show interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire , and they would be extingu@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages recipes , film night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , please do not think at the university with a relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rough treatment at the University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a Refu@@ ge@@ um , but many student homes form a space @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ mel culture , which can lead to life and socially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone who tries to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to go away , but you must go away , that I have consumed the energy for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a com@@ milit@@ ant of singing is exhausted , and send him a SMS instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apro@@ pos : do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw some things .
to close friendship through B@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you begin the university on the climax of the Back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cks to the doors of people to present themselves less strange than the welcome of 1950 &apos;s years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your fellow people feel committed to enter@@ tain himself , and will be associated with a delicious surprise at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent bak@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad missing cl@@ ots made of flour , sugar and fat cause people to place sleeping if you are ank@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food to steal is a common crime in student homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the inclin@@ ation of a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the milk owner with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chances are good that they say to operate themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone wants your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my co @-@ lived , who added their milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not make noise , people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about to be a constant person , but that you are in the true sense of the don@@ key to the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours to ask if there is something , drum &amp; bass , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she sent her neighbours to sleep two hours before they took their own music , and came to her three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be able to walk in the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice versa , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you want to stay again for your future spouse , and they will be able to see them every day and perhaps experience all common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart of his own ways - but if a hot Mit@@ inhabited teacher is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has a key in his not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fine than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good place is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a valuable and am@@ eless lesson through security , but you never forget j@@ ec@@ es of the room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connect your door , and put their keys into a glass of water that you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers do not hold their possessions at the ceiling as twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ minded , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner is built in the middle @-@ border corner houses for people who have not much money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the Mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build even more favorable and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push on the apartment market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes how quickly a cheaper living room can be created : it builds in a project of terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ dner : the most important accommodation in containers or turn@@ around , has no sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the people stay at a large part here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need enough space in the next decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very ban@@ quet , tri@@ mmed terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different , if one brings people into residential blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how high are the cost ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters per house is based on 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is over@@ looked .
six months the construction took place .
this is appropriate .
do the construction regulations have their plans complicated ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : building law , I have drawn my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially complicated , it is always the im@@ minent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ et special construction and the position regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gr@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the cities , the place is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what definitely does not mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but do not increase the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany but were built in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the poor mother or the barley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build up today and build well today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ dner ( 44 ) studied micro@@ system@@ technik in Regensburg , and was initially concerned with environmental analyses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting the application app , on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are given after installation on problems , since they receive an error message that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to handle the problem , users recommend to wait either to wait until the storm goes back or try to update iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may possibly be the deletion of apps to create space , but Apple has to be easier to delete it , and it will be easier to install and install it as soon as the process is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple will not be able to remove the update as the phone may turn off on hal@@ m ways , and this could lead to a drop of updates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ros@@ berg only Dev@@ ise : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton , just a Dev@@ ise : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the start into the key seven over@@ see race , &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 53 points separate the vice @-@ world champion in Singapore , on this Sunday of title defense and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Br@@ ite has already won seven of the twelve seasonal races , and takes the Fl@@ ut@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a Favor@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the current smo@@ g in the city state on the Great Prize of Singapore , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since days a Dun@@ st@@ glo@@ cke depends on the city , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bad Kis@@ singer Chess club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ club Bad Kis@@ sing &quot; has added another member of his ranks , thus increased the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery , 1 class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ sing has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation to counter@@ act Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players that cannot bring the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; red @-@ white &quot; is seen as an expression of his bond with the Kur@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or services of health and nursing homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we are firmly committed to our out@@ patient care service , that often easy to maintain their relatives alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the complexity of the insur@@ ers are not yet understood , the new households in J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and that is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Civil Code as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherap@@ ist treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offers from the senior building centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis , complement each other in an ideal way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the opening of the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ offices in the city centre , both business guides are especially in demographic change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this makes a good de@@ centralised infrastructure in the individual city parts of Bam@@ berg , in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office also offers numerous events and offers on the program and to invite them to a regular sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the Social Foundation is a great contribution that sen@@ iors can be able to live as independent and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men review on 17 years of Afghanistan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses seek the police for a fall in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ oral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the group , a 17 years old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters , and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men cried to the young people , and struck this with the fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg@@ ged and blood@@ shed strong from the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his two friends were astonished , they spoke to the bat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the last young man was brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment , and drove demonstrations several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one saw the vehicle , the last before the building went to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was attacked by the bat and another male person again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the aid of a drummer , one test on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last had to be brought to medical care in a hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far there is only one v@@ age tat@@ too .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second bat is about 1,@@ 65 metres tall , and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asks witnesses and consent to sign up under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Frank Müller assumes practice Fel@@ stand breaks , and invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promotion in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places on the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , however , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ lowship on 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ch@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is a successor to his successor in the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a construction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy on the first glance , when the Fel@@ lows was born years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who had completed their specialist education in the hospital and continued in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in the back@@ head that the garbage would fit well in these practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steal and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as it was , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married couple Müller liked the idea to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf , in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and the constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to get to know the families about the years and accompany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a benefit , he also see his own boss soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so you agree , the garbage bought the house with practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they will continue to dwell in frac@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up to his studies in Hanover , in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , he has been working as a Colon@@ el in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 , he was appointed for the leading emergency doctor in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed to volunteer in the DR@@ K willingness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 19 September , the practice is prepared for the new boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand , his Gat@@ tin Ur@@ sel has been specialized in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the garbage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to leave themselves as a pet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the End@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the rooms are modern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ EK@@ Gs , and need a speaking room more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 50@@ ,000 euros will get the waste from the district district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the Sam@@ t@@ congregation ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter into practice Fel@@ stand breaks , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another house practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains noisy according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who visits the garbage lesson , by the way , by the way , the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the field are taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its good@@ bye ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf a era , after all the medical doctors have been practiced for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand @-@ mun@@ zel@@ nut reminds us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the long time , she felt the long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients even more often , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband comple@@ menting , &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always pressed me from garden work , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ son and travels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven at our southern border , &quot; Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel , in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum request , this may also be &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supply and safety of the people stand in the foreground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs significant signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia consider &quot; Kor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia will continue to continue refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ore for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite so , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar was not seen in Lai@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of Ministers stressed , Slovenia wants to do his borders for refugees but not abri@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to walk in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles constantly meet with new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly around Sy@@ rer and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , the Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border would have brought migrants to the Hungarian border to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade however , however , that it may be to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor do we want to do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , at least 50 refugees in the Serbian border town S@@ id arrived in the course of the day , further buses are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers were the whole night from around 500 kilometers distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has said that Hungary has said that we are going to go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it could actually be predicted for observation of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country has been prepared for the fall of a strong state of refugees , for possible failures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he didn &apos;t called , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for limit control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to qualify strict controls , in order to qualify for membership in the room area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU partners represent a good testimony to the country since 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the side of the Hungarian border , about 300 refugees continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der Media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees want to travel to Croatian border , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm the debates about alternative routes in Hor@@ gos , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , it would not be a very high refugee pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could not say if they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
helpers of migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute refugees to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not approximate : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers were sent in the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stock h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminal , which is accused of an un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as business Wire , marketing and PR news@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exploited information , in@@ sider transactions have been made to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the investigations were reported to a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case , the processes against 32 more sh@@ ul@@ ed in the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators shall be in the United States , as well as from Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has been working for 20 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around the Mann@@ heimer Par@@ ade@@ platz , there are patho@@ gens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people do their concerns , partly fast stri@@ ves , partly cozy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ elo@@ ad life with a wonderful autumn sun , and there are four large boards each with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid took attention to her 20 years of existence and looks quite closely with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes to life , so we went with the action in the midst of the city and among the people , Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid , stands as well as questions and conversations as well as the volunteer staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while you take a fit spontaneously to the circle and the set around &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can stop the war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always again , on the edge of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make it clear that for me at the end of this world , I can responsible responsible for me at the end of this world , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public effective action was good for 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that not everyone wants to tell the tables publicly , be understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and dying shall be liable according to Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although just the Hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years have contributed much to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dying and bit@@ u@@ aries belongs to the voluntary staff of the first hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through personal experience with the subject , they read much literature and decided to get involved in the dying aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid sought to be honorary , she was reported immediately and was in 1995 in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 honorary , 43 women and two men - the subject and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all they are carefully trained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can be good with their task , and experience experiences and experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another war@@ te , keep it for precious and at the moment , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical tro@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ formance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of members and associations enables the training , training and training courses of dying and O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all two years , training sessions are offered for new employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also other personal wishes to post@@ cards , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ sed his winning view on a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its Bod@@ transport service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that she plans , about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , F@@ ed@@ ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said , earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year to earn 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts expected according to a survey of fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , the average rating of 4,@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher aggregates for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages which will be collected from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is still expected to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the holidays @-@ employment were announced a day later than the rival UPS , which plans to set 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research answered analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has resulted in a decline in international priority shipping , which brought the sales in its unit Express shipping to the st@@ ag@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the boom in online shopping has increased the results in F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter , sales of Bod@@ transport around 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express Unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was decreased due to higher labour costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they joined 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve Strategy spend two days of this week around a 27 foot Honduras Ma@@ ho@@ oni @-@ table sitting in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end of them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting area is a wall image of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen , and their colleagues put the economic interests of the nation before all other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a second order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to exp@@ ire from the unprecedented incentive rate since the end of 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ences of the global financial markets could strengthen these volumes through the increase of interest for federal bonds - and be only a quarter percentage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing that they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economic in the mac@@ ular company Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market enough to wait enough to wait , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , what is the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were asked recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted this week before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets are waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ st@@ ator , which is only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strategy will be mil@@ led by making a further increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this time , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they are not in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argue that a interest increase the financial markets , because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase in good ways to increase the sentence of 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the month conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be expected to increase in an increase of the proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed slow@@ down , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate fell on 5,@@ 1 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed is seen as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation went constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it due to the tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ise , Chief Executive Officer at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets on all over the world sent together the end of the last month , after China had its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell more than 16 % under its highest level , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would be the global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this month , the market has a little re@@ covering , whereby the D@@ ow now is about 10 % under the H@@ och of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representative , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred , &quot; Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the world economy is not the main part of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the influence of the central bank was enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere note of the former Lei@@ ters Ben S. Bern@@ ese in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be able to narrow its mon@@ astic expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ ruption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies of economies are increasingly expected that they can not only monitor developments in other position , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey Pain@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noticed this month that &quot; F@@ ed a story of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which are apparently not linked to the economic foundations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacqu@@ ers , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is responsible for a interest increase in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Asia , a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their bodies into three sessions &quot; despite limited recognition impact on growth in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market of the market , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this plane , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation in which they are afraid of a interest rate because the markets became exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ oses , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour through the corri@@ dors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the whole shopping is hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the cups , and has several co @-@ operation options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where he is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , together with other shops and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living assistance for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees come to Germany in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of innumerable volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there is a number of people who support un@@ intrin@@ sic asylum seekers in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to them include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with their 74 gaps , they are still happy to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan , the German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is quite different lessons than at a right school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brazilian Pap@@ di@@ at@@ rical Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy styles
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian Museum SP@@ RS tries to clarify on sho@@ cking way women , how important good food is used during the down@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies need to build all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get to increase their daily calorie intake around 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher calorie intake is not the only di@@ gesti@@ ble adaptation to the mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a current study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet fluctu@@ ates women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municip@@ ality of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2,@@ 3 million Euros expensive sports hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he made an exception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roof may be flat for solar system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the long @-@ looking gym building on the Bern@@ ese of the sports grounds come forward to step forward : in the recent community meeting , the completed construction of construction without great discussions has been denied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had decided to have a request for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get a wonderful large south roof together , &quot; says Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - unlike the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the construction plan on the roof of the roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create any precision case , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports centre on the sports centre is a community project of the municipality , and S@@ V Bern@@ ried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the expense , approximately 2,@@ 3 million euros are calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sports promotion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next process step , the building entry for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Federal Reserve Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg attracts Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is supposed to be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is at the University of Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ gan@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the country , the landing tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Supervisory Board of the Supervisory Board , and the remaining Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees are busy at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White should be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the staff will be informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change has been triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , which is only since the beginning of the start of the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic , and now at a private practice near the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the question , who is supposed to take place , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game which was ready to take over from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years , fishermen will lead to his team when the Supervisory Board will lead to both houses , until the next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ berg has to be closed after almost 140 years after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the Land@@ kreis had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim is completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing at J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ors , which is located in the possession of the Federal Office , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present there are a short time maintenance of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better it could not happen , such a chance does not come back to the Le@@ ch move to the Le@@ ch , who has received positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen has been working for over 30 years as chief doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues , to take the post of the medical directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent decades , the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closing , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth@@ aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the hand of all the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are in the evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ische HC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wuppertal , the leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is the clear Favor@@ it , but there is none . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , the bathroom had a painful defeat and have something good there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hunting case with two verses at Pr@@ at@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two tractors are injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on the service afternoon by sh@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the aber@@ ration on a Ma@@ is@@ feld at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were used as police officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought in hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exactly it could come to the accident , it was unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crime police was determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz victims of violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime suspi@@ cious has led the police for suffering from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the arrest of the 20 year old , young people killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz has fallen victim to victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a suspi@@ cious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , which was indeed given the indication , and the investig@@ ators led to the location of the corp@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , not as agreed upon home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ator was first given to personal objects of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respon@@ dents in the friends of the friend and the circle of the mis@@ sile , there was a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpet@@ rators led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the arrest , the authorities gave the authorities to put the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ ses into the channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old should be led on Wednesday to the port , the investig@@ ators lay down the burden on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing
the location on the German apartment market is tense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even more refugees are looking for a paid pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the German apartment market , the distribution of distribution on the German housing market have long begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and work seekers from the EU , more people push more people to a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with welcome citizens around the last paid apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cover demand for paid apartments , until 2020 every year 400@@ ,000 new units would be built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this result , a study on behalf of the association of social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for comparison : in this year , 26@@ 0.000 units are finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in a first meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them come to the apartment market , and in the long loop before the rent apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Statisti@@ cal Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only on the rising refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant changes in the housing policy of the last years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is a residential deficit in front of the year , which is bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently in the balloon areas there are some 77@@ ,000 residential units such as Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , many professionals lived in major cities in WG @-@ rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for young adults , young adults stayed at the apartment market un@@ voluntary longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per head declined in the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , new incentives should be re@@ chargeable to social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the tax income could be exposed to the atro@@ cities and the basic tax for funded apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the alliance , an attractive tax depreciation are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank Kf@@ W comes with cities and churches already well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the project could even be repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have free joints : Croatia and Slovenia , Kor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no escape , there are more refugees in the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia , to the north without hur@@ dles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Croatia , Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria , and belongs to the Schengen zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is still not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the depreciation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungary , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came in force on the same day , making it virtually unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Croatia , the refugees will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , women , children and men who live and want to achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had opened the first refugees at the border Ser@@ bi@@ ens to the EU neighbouring Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the media reports according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they came with the bus as well as taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees don &apos;t come to the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the border strips other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , min@@ ers should now create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungary , however , after the closing of the border hardly more refugees come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police rose 3@@ 66 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Tor@@ que on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws , the overcoming and damage of the border z@@ a@@ us as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to five years , arrest warrant for five years and the deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , one was arrested on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicant are 13 families with young children , as well as two older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , nobody has a view to receive asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expi@@ red asylum seekers should go down there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were assembled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to go down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they gathered the garbage , leaving tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pl@@ ywood were disman@@ tled , and one of the recording ager was rebuilt in the border location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the purpose of this transformation , no one wanted to express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , there are only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the 20,000 migrants , but still in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge feast on Sunday , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent at the entrance of the tent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , because Germany was surprisingly set by the refugee traffic with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , so that the city was built immediately with two other hel@@ mets and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , we have the un@@ hoped guests once again , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was of course of course , &quot; Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation , 100 Euro for fire fighting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in a regional train towards Passa@@ u , the train traffic was set to Germany after the short notice that the train traffic has been set to Germany , but still on the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the regional train was removed from the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border is generally high in the course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbors held on Sunday , day before a branch of sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends thousands of thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a apparent sacred policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the bearings of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures , our Chancellor has been highly officially opened and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ole of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are confronted with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry must also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is invited and welcome , nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the winter winter , with us decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be an even greater , peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ ing quar@@ ry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Konrad has full hands to do all hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad , it is usual that his word has weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received Konrad in the handle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria , he said , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , the Interior Ministry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ry in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , you have to find 3@@ 5.000 accommodation in the next few weeks - 20,000 will deliver the countries to 15,000 the covenant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no f@@ ass without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the national leaders , he has already led talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these would have been secured to him , even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it is good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , where the Church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform , private individuals can offer self @-@ catering flats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in emergency times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must comply with a certain height of the hand holder or size of the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , emergency standards would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , which you do not say without further into the face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier cause no costs , as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to increase their employees on three to four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , its own quot@@ a search was not successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to set a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are apparently problems with permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Linz requires a better distribution
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because they could not be under@@ estimated without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for an emergency , further locations should be checked for their diving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criticism of the city leader in the division of refugees within the federal country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other districts also need to afford their contribution here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; se@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a long @-@ term telephone at the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the State Executive Officer Josef P@@ it@@ inger ( VP ) was added to the refugee demand in the refugee demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; se@@ of@@ er has assured me , that the German borders will not be removed too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , special trains with refugees in Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the protective search would be brought to Germany with regular trains to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ aci@@ inger demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general san@@ itation of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four of the six floors of the office and production building is the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could imagine to invest in Star@@ tup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later to compete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.@@ 3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building is powered by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T , and Tech@@ Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of the rest area in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to break the 49 @-@ year old In@@ hab@@ erin of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has now received an increase in the form of another business loc@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , turns all around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , cash stock exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , several weeks was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve been able to open a shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers , who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the natives in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her fashion interest has been put into the cra@@ dle of her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in the bag , can &apos;t answer the professional woman with last security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , it is that a beautiful bag is upgraded every outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ alog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property combines some of them with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he is hostile to strange , journalists , or knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicants for the US Pres@@ idency will be strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also be registered in the old town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of the real estate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York , with the F@@ oot @-@ refreshing , is a concept of many in the win@@ zer@@ dorf on the vineyard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the 1200 inhabitants of the 1200 inhabitants , which is related to him , is related to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal , powerful man of the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that will find the somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their knees , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump &apos;s K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz , the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has turned an am@@ ant documentary about the place and its famous jumps to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for you , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the heart of the heart , he has not brought it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also in the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big Moor@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; random the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high German : the lawyers , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the bond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foundation of the real estate company , first property purchases in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of traction : you wish to return to the country , the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was not absorbed by Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for the oldest history and folk music , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is in contrast to the most striking statements of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was repeated over Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born in Heinz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement does not see the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ anded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pen@@ on@@ ika Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz at a visit something for the church gel ended , which is generally good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can &apos;t imagine me from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had at the time of his grandfather in the United States , would have been as he would never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wend@@ els film , for the tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ dar@@ ger saw the interest in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is the first &quot; mining village &quot; in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ eering villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the dor@@ sal alpine association is responsible for the award of the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; mining village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one fifth of its surface must be regarded as a protective area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine , the loss of leadership in the Today show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son miles to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report on the loss of leadership of liber@@ als , but it has no big shifts in the reviews for Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the German capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Riv@@ ale sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ days , in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the down@@ side seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since the average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators generated at the five main cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , a slight increase compared to Rat@@ ings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Today has closed the gap to the sunrise period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , Today , at the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of the sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0.000 and 50,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Sunrise at the average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spectators are at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most interesting thing , which happens every morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winds of the mur@@ ders concern this morning , more than the Parliament ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl and Lisa are in order , thanks for the review ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama about a recently restored father , who closes himself with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Re@@ bec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this , with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators , and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven had mixed results in the evening , two of The Ch@@ ase Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e in average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped up to 6@@ 23.@@ 000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening , the first half an hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot water at the average 6@@ 20,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second evening , the decline in the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute , which did not manage the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally published as &apos; Sunrise domin@@ ates , while Today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three voices agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly have ignorant who The Bachelor wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the woman , at Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor , has been preserved in the greatest intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not the three left @-@ left girls will certainly not give up , whether it is the one that has received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you might accidentally delete a hint who will be the victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam Wood keeps his lips until the final on Thursday , sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left to ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man , and called his sense for humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is questioned , &quot; If not you who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki are both fast - except yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went to the house , and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that she was quite compatible with the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be with you , added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she would be well suited for Sam Wood as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week was clear that Wood &quot; the One could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now able to send it to him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not her , then she was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love the remaining girls alike - it is an accident between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 AM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally published as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the USA , and there were many other teams who sent after his impressive open training day at the end of the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a , and it looks like a wise decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some trainers would like to be ban@@ ished for the rest of the game on the bank , as he lost a Ger@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband , and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the envelope , after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of his R@@ ook@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who told him to forget his promised catch and take care of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t in a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the game field and told later the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Da@@ y@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that is happening now , you just take care of the next game , and this is &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne seduc@@ ed the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at the time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne posing for a photo with fans , and holds a Australian flag after the game and post it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet , to discuss rights of swelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s rich man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian roller field with arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had demanded Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was sentenced to his oil company Yu@@ cat@@ chy , and his democratic efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters call for the high refugee pay the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn autumn , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger was unable to preserve new teachers at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get inter@@ ferences in the Bavarian Education System . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landing fra@@ grant of the Free voters t@@ opped up to Friday in the underground Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , other main topics were planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ store the cla@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called the establishment of UNO protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the nin@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it doesn &apos;t go further , we have to say to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for asylum seekers , the Free voters want to move quickly as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be handy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the national policy should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a years of permanent torch remains on the agenda : the educational policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , Kul@@ tus Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has been tested the pilot test &quot; middle level plus &quot; in which an extension of the middle class of three for four years will be tested for nine years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge for all the students who want to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free drive at G@@ 9 , where it is desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax to the jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German stock market , the German stock market has closed a wide variety of distances and nervous trading course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid profits also bu@@ ys the trading stations in London and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the D@@ ow Jones Index last approximately 1 percent in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve the interest rate in the United States , the markets will take place in the United States and also for the big arrest of the dates on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion around the loads from the atomic rose has pressed the shares of RW@@ E in time to a record , and left deep traces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies had a little bit lost , but ultimately 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6,@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Infin@@ eon shares rose at the D@@ ax tip for further 3,@@ 22 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the U.S. An@@ le@@ ger@@ ator was in &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , investors at the German chip@@ bauer is currently too little attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the investment in the current wafer technology and the focus on the automation market should pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; auto@@ values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , there were again more cars than in the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers of the motor@@ auer Daimler and BMW laid around 1,@@ 34 percent or 2,@@ 21 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen benefits made up to 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the German pension market , the return on the German pension market fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension index Re@@ x rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the covenant @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , the course of the Euro decreased to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 people killed , after polic@@ emen were thrown on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police elas@@ tic@@ ated against the proposed new constitution , he said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence broke down on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , chief district officers , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , some of you cast stones and fire bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police saw Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then poured into the air before they returned to rubber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 police and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ fin , of which is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ as southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ten@@ i say that new provinces are formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to want a state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August were killed as the four major political parties signed an agreement , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which is centrally governed by centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed in April thousands of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legislature have said this week over certain clause in the constitutional design in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could occur on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction area planned in the city
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the property at the Em@@ der Youth Center Old Post is supposed to be built again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the city is currently preparing for the marketing of 4000 square meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mixture of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are still not planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a round of 4000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the youth centre of the Old Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparations are currently running .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you wait for appropriate offers , it is called the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the investor &apos;s question is not clear , it is not clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , no contracts have been closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the land , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Big Street , already before a few months ago and the building can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ieve Project H@@ ieve : details are located on the table
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant@@ ations for the vacation close to the little sea at Em@@ den take shape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the investor set public plans for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some An@@ li@@ eger are further wor@@ rying , they fear the sale of their leisure activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monthly el@@ ang was hidden behind closed doors , cl@@ amped and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the plans for a new vacation close to the little sea are close to Em@@ den on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ ent , the medium @-@ sized emig@@ ration company &quot; system construction , presented his plans for the first time in the city development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ined from the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; we did not have any answer to all questions , &quot; said he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was good to meet all the rum@@ ors now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the approximately ten to twelve million euros has been in the discussion since months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent reactions under the sea owners who had come into the session , the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea land@@ owners and board member of the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , said : &quot; this will be a huge cl@@ ot@@ z , all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critic , that the traffic would be greatly increased by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly on the good one hectare of the former guest house is happening , however , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

N@@ HC says 60 percent chance for cycl@@ one south of the Cape Verde Islands
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US National Hurri@@ cane Center said about 350 miles ( 5@@ 60 km ) south of the southern Cape Verde islands , which has a 60 percent chance to develop a tropical verteb@@ ral tower in the next 48 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google launches the double @-@ double donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ double donations campaign , which should help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they flee from the war , to flee from the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations , on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey belonged to many dark railway and bus rides , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had luck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / , er@@ eli@@ ef to 11 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has been distributed over 4 million people in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many fled from the war of Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; Processing of Christian Pl@@ aces
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for easy excessive diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advantages of weight loss surgery for easy over@@ crowded people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say , if easily over@@ crowded people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live as those who do not receive surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dying data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a Editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight loss or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity operations have been proven to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24@@ ,@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have been collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c acid and ga@@ stri@@ c acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BM@@ I under which this surgery decreased , from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained at those who are non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who are subjected to surgical intervention , 36 % of diabetes disease was completely covered with 28 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes only two percent compared with a percentage of only two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; is generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers monitored the patients @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c will be held at the best under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the medical therapy group remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced mortality in five years , so the researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research team also includes average results in the two types of surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to low @-@ fat people who have undergone a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love history plays in Hun@@ sr@@ ück
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an issue that is currently increasing in Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tics : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ expect@@ edly , meets the warm of their youth , and this is in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recently published novel , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for dog back readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main professional author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler , and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama said the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called the interests of humanity before the interests of the individual nations , or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed that the reaction of Western European countries have admired the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to take several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , as a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never resolved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence , and commented on George Bus@@ hs actions according to the terrorist attack on 11 September and set out that the non @-@ violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 11 September I have expressed my applause in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat down , and the Dalai Lama said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quarter@@ ly increase of intake of hanging dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxins centers in the USA report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed a strong alcoholic hand infection , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , increased the cases of revenues in children under 12 years , the poison control centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 on 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are always more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency recording , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children are disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink , while some of them do to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ing in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; videos on YouTube show how teenagers dis@@ infection can only drink because of a cheap experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mouth water , to obtain a tough@@ er drink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children can be used by attractive jets of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine @-@ smoking and orange du@@ ft , which are very appealing for children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hanging dis@@ infection contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in small children , a few spray can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you would not be able to stand whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come from it , it &apos;s a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl , which had recently taken four injection of straw@@ berry in school , was taken into an emergency intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally regarded by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , which she treated at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlan@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te their words and was not able to go in the position , when they arrived in the emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate child health hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol , and he said , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very angry , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been fatal for my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with death cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of hanging dis@@ infection , which had a toxic , non @-@ destructive ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol enth@@ i@@ elt , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it is a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , and verbal them out of their space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ swivel : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a drive on the cross @-@ gap between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on Her@@ od , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year truck driver continued on the cross@@ roads in the direction of round@@ about industrial area and took too late , that on the round@@ about two expected vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , he joined the rear of an audi@@ torium in the rear of an audi@@ tor and whether this vehicle is on one before the Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident of the accident , the police was reduced by about 10 000 euros , shares the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Audi of 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready , and had to be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rum@@ ors : no Dis@@ harmon@@ ie at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the Ger@@ ede of Dis@@ harmon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la gives that the testi@@ ops are on a bad place , but that he will turn it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA because of the training of N@@ eil@@ son , and war@@ bur@@ ton be cau@@ tious with January @-@ new obligations that could destroy the unity of the ca@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ons increase guidance on Celtic on five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meters in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a crisp victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede over Dis@@ harmon@@ ie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors about dis@@ harmon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this consisted of increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of title competition in the Scottish football , Nieder@@ lands - de Bo@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former R@@ angers centre player and former national players of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans are interested in Celtic football , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about both teams , and that &apos;s what they are interested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn the things around , pregnant Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic fight must fight , but the Norwegian boss of schw@@ or to turn things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed the defeat at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already been bad times , and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , we want to come out as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel that exactly , but we must continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments before just a few weeks ago , R@@ angers @-@ Bos@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious with the signing of new accessible and be@@ aded that it does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x ca@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who come in summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes more damage , you will need to add unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with return content
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ storms Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicates that he could withdraw from his contract with Sw@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed for two years with a smiling ank@@ le , and has not managed the departure from Wales in this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA Battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field , and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was removed later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
avoid Griff@@ i@@ ths to avoid ty@@ po@@ ast@@ le
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ repaired Hi@@ bee was rejected , after he gave a song about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh to Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the eye , &quot; said the storms and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le when it is not playing for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly be@@ aded that the executive board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team , however , is that the decline in the field of playing is necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back on Tra@@ b , &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to win Hamilton &quot; un@@ nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ tions , to see a seventh consecutive league victory to see a seventh consecutive league victory against Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew that has won everything in poker games or li@@ gen , the games of this kind also won &apos;t be won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they rise in the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period of 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schot@@ t@@ lands unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , such as the figures of the office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell to 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment ratio for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4,@@ 0 percent - a number over the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest numbers and said , &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly one year , that Scotland has made the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dec@@ eased the exp@@ iry of the exp@@ iry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the security personnel could not be able to make peace , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the use of pe@@ pper@@ spray , the officials could take into awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a breath @-@ alcoholic test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year 0.@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing growing was picked up by his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year old had 2,@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le , and remained first in awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why I will be a witness in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an audience gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p will be ex@@ hil@@ ated by toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation was already the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the day returned , I began to fear me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists may be seen in the USA , and there are often more applications as places available to decide who is chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is selected , who will observe it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , which I have developed my own relationship with telephone and a two and a half hours visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we often laugh much , if we speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just have to try to remember all the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the history of the prisoners , as he wants to get it , and you will receive access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call me with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took place that they could have better form@@ ulate it , but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said , and wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not say to me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he wants to present an international repor@@ ter , to write there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is un@@ guilty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his acts according to the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to him , a bene@@ fici@@ ary of deed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that his execution is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and from this perspective , I will die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot claim , really obj@@ ectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other repor@@ ters , where you can contact them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you will get from me is what it means to see a man a certain death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man after feudal police persec@@ ut@@ ors go over to come from the C@@ anning River &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry , when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt to hang a man from Per@@ th to hang the police , only a few meters from a police officers who tried to pass it gently to return to the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house of peace fall in pel@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the mighty , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water , and said &apos; I come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uni@@ form , therefore he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master@@ y football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins went to his car in the atro@@ cities to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspiring locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to stop him , and threat@@ ens to end the race sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , and threatened to end the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity department of Racing Victoria , saying that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday , passed through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the race sport , and he himself found themselves under difficult conditions when it was the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had returned 18 months because of the spi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations , and did not want to see it as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to say nothing to say , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything is coming out , said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes one responds , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will go back home tonight , and sleep well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to the head , and I would like to think that my owners think that I try my best for her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they begin to think , I do not do this , then I should not be more trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about what I do with my license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , Moo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ity department had tried to cut off his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - I will be asked if I am asked to supply information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they obviously believe that I am a bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is the case , they should certainly be able to write to her n@@ oses because they have tried to write me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ der , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ o , the current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should I bring it to the view that it will be personally ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has the R@@ V@@ L itself , and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what is happening in the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps people think that I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take me my license , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am now at the point where it is no matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them , and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , the best known by his preparation of the un@@ slaugh@@ tered master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous after a pack of mud or sound on the horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take the full responsibility for it , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees have corrupted mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday evening , it would have been so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , the whole day could be so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it had also been so on the race day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . a study of this matter was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a joke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who set these rules , do not know about the horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here &apos;s too far , Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver cursed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a meeting with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cyclists was delivered with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries , after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the driver continued to stop without stopping the last driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 years old man made from N@@ ath@@ alia &apos;s police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is expected to be accused of driver and subordin@@ ate assistance , because of other traffic jams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cyclists , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram remains in the hospital . it is located in a stable condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy , criticism of the Tac@@ tics of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Prime Minister favorites of N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said , that the arbit@@ ration of the Storm players &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little covered note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defense the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that they are focused on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added to the criticism of two leading trainers at his team &apos;s team , as it would be worried that they were worried about the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson about ring struggles said to us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have changed in the whole year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical to a real focus , and this has done the trend for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is already funny , as it comes back to this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and remember that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Prime Minister League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a divorce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play , and we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ball game that you want to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us than it went around the Big Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster was a higher result , than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is it a thrilling game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are breaks , and do not have any points ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , there are the game plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Storm team has free from this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit to drug position
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man , which possibly threat@@ ens a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his understanding , the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , was released against Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested for the last month after the German police rose 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America about Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ participated in the J@@ ach@@ era Road@@ house during the afternoon and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , that he tried to possess the whole amount and have been in the café from a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judges at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the floods at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations to Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the criminal cause , he has bel@@ ated the police about his residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and boots had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together , to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone is not enough to stop him , not to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against the deposit , under the conditions that he returns his Australian and his Serbian Pass , and at a starting point of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : leadership house , apart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver is hard to viol@@ ate a truck driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of a permanent construction site , two of the trucks had a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain , in the last moment after the left , like the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guide house of the accident is completely apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver was badly injured in a hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed over six hours to 2 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used the phone of girls to attract p@@ ant@@ ophi@@ le to send images , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a P@@ man op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the telephone of the girl , as this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service that he received a number of un@@ successful pictures of children who sent him from another user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl woke up later , and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it through , the conf@@ essed messages and alar@@ ming immediately found her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police saw himself and saw the five images , analytical then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ research , the terms for the search for unexpected pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ idea Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a Su@@ cht that he would be addic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave the search on the computer from him , but said it was to be done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to be fri@@ ghtened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked after his conversations with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he did it to attract them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he will see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girls found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the lemon and the wines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone , and joined the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the defend@@ ant computer and plac@@ yst@@ ation was used to speak with girls who saw a lot of younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , explained guilty in the sense of the indictment , have been guilty of the indictment on 25 January of this year , and not before judgment on 24 March of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual crimes , as you could argue that &quot; no significant sexually element &quot; can be found in his understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael swal@@ lowed up the judgement until October , to receive background reports on social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg was granted in this case deposit , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the date of the urine , he was added to the directory of sexual crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tow@@ ing soft to small border crossing to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are removed from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many bad users left out of fear , and the people increased to smaller border outputs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the German police officer said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the border of the river Inn , Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn became more than 1000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were walking through bridges and dust , on the German side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they will be accepted by federal police officers , and forwarded to registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich Central Station , the Federal Police Office met again in comparison to the date of weekends on Wednesday , more refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only 700 people arrived in the capital of capital alone , said a speaker at the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the re@@ introduction of checks at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : reloc@@ ation of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meteor@@ ologists warn against Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to an underground area over Western Europe , warm marine air flows into the country , the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past days , the strong fun@@ nel is the extinction of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms &quot; Henry &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic islands over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy storms and thunder@@ storm are expected especially in Baden , especially in Baden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest is still early in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ bisch Al@@ b and at the bottom of the floor with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , there is no longer the sun again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass makes it : all two years show the motor@@ bikes at the IAA in the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the compact car is particularly well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly important : around 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new@@ bor@@ ehol@@ es fell to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone on this segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in the IAA ( audience days , 17 to 27 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German motor@@ bikes is the Opel Astra , which is in autumn with the dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; says Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel presents a entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra provides a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also count three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a second version , a second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what will be driven next to the Astra at the IAA in addition to new compact cars ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively regarded as a fifth level in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the next year , he also comes as a Com@@ bi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits fully into the design line of the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the base model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 liter turbo@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum torque is calculated according to manufacturer data at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales start of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class seman@@ ell DS 4 , which is at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid the front part in front of the front part : here the cool@@ ers was newly drawn and equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ otainment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons can be reduced by a touch@@ screen and also integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the compact class , the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI is added to the IAA in the compact class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are decent
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a ex @-@ prisoner of Justice Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell in a small cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation when they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on Wednesday , published by the Federal Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the persons concerned , the judges can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its constitutional complaint , a ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe in Karlsruhe and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was not separate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man who was once again moved to his An@@ wal@@ ts again on free foot , moved into a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the un@@ ambig@@ uous conditions against the country of Berlin , his ministers were able to fail against the country of Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the constitutional court took up the judgment of the Chamber of the Chamber of Berlin , and transferred the case to the renewed test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they see the human dignity of man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons of the demand period , only a few days of liability for the compensation would be significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court has to clear the amount of money damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the Constitutional Court often have strengthened the rights of criminal prosecution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they said only in April to a prisoner , because he was imprisoned in a cell in a cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , a decision from 2011 is also the majority of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over three months , the sewage treatment was placed between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in Karlsruhe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines for the last weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the prisoners will always be included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ vel , it should have already come to the right position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to information of the Justice of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Ministry in Germany , according to the statement by Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated in the view of the unusual challenge , &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Germany , the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used for different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , and the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all paid rentals : annually 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments will also apply refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Federal Minister Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot too little is from the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments annually , and must invest a promotion of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates of the institute for labour market and professional research , the long @-@ term 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked after their qualification to help them with the introduction , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording of the project , but also for self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , the migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the past , a working ban for asylum seekers from up to five years was reduced to three months , as well as the residen@@ cy , asylum seekers to a residential location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - even because of the specialist in the company , it is also possible that refugees need to be able to access the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dles for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most common by personal contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the building of networks is therefore to view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s royal way to work integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ able , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to convince the family to convince the benefits of K@@ ita , the administration hand@@ held in various languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the need to increase through the large number of refugees would try to increase the training capacity - for example , by giving more specialist schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students are prepared without German knowledge in welcome lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no lack of lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ eps from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Student Works estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , there is no federal asylum for asylum seekers or patient - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank handle ( CD@@ U ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , students could be able to facilitate access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence refund or D@@ ul@@ arity , no services will receive any services according to asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter is generally not a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1st January 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play an important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should develop the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state of religions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the creation of a Islamic welfare association , who takes care of professionally around the newcom@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right hand , duties include duties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the representative of Islam must be on clear contact person , and ready to work with the state in many areas and to provide certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also belongs to the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , condemned the concern , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to change the majority of society , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a crisp decade a anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory office and a General Assembly Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very slow how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ Series was shown in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : what migration organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German are committed to the next few years , when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany , in general , Germany has been able to supply the expected refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities are concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to the day of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , additional money needs to flow into the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls to all types of arrival at the registration of health cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , services could be expected later with the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited performance catalogue can be used for the asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the Berlin Health Science The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters should be taken over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many refugees have been helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee camps , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and the young people go to HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partly other disease pictures of German doctors , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite case or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians would have had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to practice practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and let it be repeated again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to estimates of the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or under depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently published study of the TU Munich , that every fifth Syrian refugees are trau@@ matic trau@@ matic in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , it suffers from other things to so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other symptoms are sleeping and concentration disorders , strong shame and emotional do@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the symptoms chronic , be an early treatment necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ic sick asylum seekers can make a request for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , agents or doctors who are not trained for psychological diseases would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often lead to error , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dre@@ aming
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the traditions of the cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and a special entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ per invites the man@@ ners on the brick , W@@ ases to dre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine , without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ inary and junior discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; - under this motto , the current manoeu@@ vre stands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the blood , the family is in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is important to take people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ tras with World City flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program of the cir@@ cus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with joke and charm in their spell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Castill@@ o Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heroes of the dum@@ b films , it wants to loose the Cuban duo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lightness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her humor@@ ous art at the mast should conquer women &apos;s her@@ nia in the storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from numerous salmon salt , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus is also fascinated with finger@@ tips and joints . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
balanced with the wheel on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little others and fascinated with their flexibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ im . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes place : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t know our animals well , it &apos;s not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sans &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal doesn &apos;t feel , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the Man@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the highest commandment is : good for animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on her zeb@@ ra Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra , the family is proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals have lived eight years , and nothing is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ im . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ ra is not ready for the manoeu@@ vre , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each visitor , something is likely to be something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one is sure &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ per : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ per invites 17 to 20 , daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock , prices are reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ff@@ au is open from 10 to 18 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ ch holds false speech in parliament , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ ch , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium to the stairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained intact , but the video of the Falls spread quickly over the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also killed by the claims of MEPs of the opposition , they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ ch with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month , they had expi@@ red him , and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Change Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ tical politicians SMS messages have received on their hand &apos;s hand , who warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ til@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she told the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; said journalists to Mu@@ til@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warns the affected Parliament members , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was concerned , &quot; concerned about the dangers of politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts to the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP will be divided into two listed companies and the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive Board , which should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenues and will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies , such as an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , one called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has a massive restructuring , to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is based on conviction that closely focused companies will provide better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger stressed opposite Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and if its rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history his participation in the European Championship is still uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate buttons , and then returned to his old momentum during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury threatened not the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a bone , which is not well healed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no greater matter .
this was only an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in connection with his buttons , or with the injuries that he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true of pure medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also a comfortable pattern , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ ection Ltd , 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut was six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also played only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 15@@ 7 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five game times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wider image for ar@@ senal is that they have been in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Prime Minister Clubs , who have been taking part in the majority of injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation , you have a time period of time you need to strengthen your body and win combat power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope to stabili@@ ze his body , I am confident that he will do it , and he will pass a career from the way he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb , against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ track on the coming Wednesday , and turning a rotation within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of retro@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to treat a small break @-@ break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Ar@@ senal is clear favour@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ me stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest en@@ vy effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; unexpected &quot; campaign in the last season was started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Ar@@ senal has drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League chapters against Monaco , and remains from the far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ar@@ senal , it has never been working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close to the year 2006 , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ edy Show : the Com@@ edy Show , given us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in view of how the need for men to open , now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ H@@ och . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ced ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a poor life ) 2015 as the year of man to ask the culture in question when they need help to seek help if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friendship is the heart in the fight to master this challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students presented with depres@@ sive symptoms , that if the suffering had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had doubled his chances of gene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of social media , communication with its focus on substance is often more important than a significant contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ist values , money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like a video pi@@ el invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can &apos;t buy luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Beautiful at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ ins and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can rely on any case , even if they are often back to explore completely their feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of the telephone care , it explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense , when I try to offer long @-@ term stability mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so very my object @-@ related external status on the phone can also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed backdrop , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria meets PS@@ G to help Malm@@ ö , Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angel Di Maria celebrates his hits against Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they had increased its lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris also requires a strong start against the Swedish masters , but not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while they got the points , there was no Classi@@ ses@@ pi@@ el of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs . he was started in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his career career in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or backwards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents , even if there are certain things that we need to be perf@@ ected during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , that we have not yet achieved one or two other gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to his violation in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was born in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month of Manchester United Nations , the Argent@@ inian wing of the Argent@@ ine@@ tis was taken over the last month of Manchester United . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone believed that PS@@ G would be a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off , in order to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ ditions P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , the PS@@ G had no less than five attempts alone , which was not less than five attempts alone in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , the Di Maria in a turning point , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could stop the end result before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league that has not the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new particip@@ ations to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the rainy highway , then the evil awakening came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

world and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago , in front of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played back to the FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish Master , three times poker tournament winner , four times Club World Champion , two times European Championship , a world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in summer , the FC Barcelona left the FC Barcelona and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i announces that he already stood before the departure from Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said that Bar@@ ça would sell me to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the registered FC Bavaria , also the FC Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i was not changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the change was not concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the decisive man is working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken under contract , and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P has told me that I would not change the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who knows how Bay@@ course season 2008 / 2009 , X@@ av@@ i was going to run with X@@ av@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , put the red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the King &apos;s triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matt Dam@@ on , the Afgh@@ an American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown joined the diversity and said , she will not need behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a consequence of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke down as the necessity of alternative perspectives , and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it at the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; secured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown was shocked , with bel@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to use people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and it is a niche that is beaten by their white strain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the Director @-@ Rights on the Film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction , at the end of us could give us something that we do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the soci@@ als explo@@ ded the social media before mis@@ use of Dam@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip by using &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain her diversity - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ladies comments come at a time , at the exact racial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s nationwide effect and the authorities , discrimin@@ ating practices and criminal practices were killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made an invitation to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album silent &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their significance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter has published a explanation and considered reaction to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he has received the invitation , or hit the Pope , is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos;s first champion
professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which was just its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which was able to complete all stages of its obstacle plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time when he was the first ath@@ lete , who ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ fighting victory , still under the shock over the profit of the Great Prize of 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or had to life , &quot; Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine , how this is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he ended as first at all , not any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it is the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and the life changes , it receives the great congratulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that he is a groove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is just so happy to have done what he has done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received fans from fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is such a great guy , and a family father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think that Isaac would have felt as well , if they had deaf the rolls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an ast@@ ounding season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ander to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , they were once one of the best teams in Bas@@ eball , today the tiger on the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ wins have a chance for Ascension within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult for a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two inner , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and made three rings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was only the third successful start in his last nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will end this year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to throw away every game , and therefore I want to go into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two rings , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the sleeping wood well curved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Excell@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good from when ( punch training ) , saw a lot better from the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the In@@ ning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran Wall , the only man , with whom he was confronted with whom he was faced , before the designed R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , the rect@@ angle of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of spo@@ ils and the conclusion run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this season , there was a double play in the Major League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit at the end of the ninth inner , the Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ less of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , S@@ ano , however , S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Detroit , Detroit benefited from one another not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three rest in the first two inner ings against the rect@@ angle veter@@ an , which had been painted before the game from the injury list , after he had been frozen for a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , Hus@@ o gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who managed a single &quot; up the &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game as he tried to reach the third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second , a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was not particularly well beaten , but he know@@ eth the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , no points in the third in@@ ning before he was replaced by the rel@@ o@@ ever rect@@ angle A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three rings at six hits and a Walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cast the European states &quot; collective path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , you have been happy that the Kel@@ ch has passed a military participation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Washington , the former German ambassador in Washington also called a massive increase of international assistance on site for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controlled in southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , Austria also has introduced inspections to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , according to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , Germany have no refugees returned to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain number of refugees from Austria per day could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures called them not , and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and their Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU state and government leaders a special summit for the next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet visited a joint approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the covenant will take this together with the countries that Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor office in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need to protect against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but who did not have a lead perspective , cannot remain in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conception was rejected in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed , the state had to cope with a huge force of strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the night , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours , the government announced in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbourhood is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungary , Hungary would like to prevent tu@@ gs from Romania , Hungary , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said to the planned new border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first verses of people who had passed through the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , thousands of migrants reported on the road to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is found on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the ic@@ e@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ ardo En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the moon turned slightly on his train around the ring planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this do@@ ve movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it means a message of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers represent their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the iron ceiling of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus liquid water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; was discovered in 2006 Eis@@ vul@@ can@@ e at the southern pole of the Satur@@ n@@ ingen , which sp@@ ends water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least at the southern pole , there must be an underground sea , and the astronom@@ ers were at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the expansion of the hidden oceans was not clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama is missing 1860 München several weeks

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis is expected to take four weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties presented a defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium , and stood before the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should rise into the running training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious blonde . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , which is often seen from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar , especially Sac@@ char@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy are the exotic fruits still : in them include B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Before everything , Man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eat the fruit , supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or to be fixed and pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the formwork color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should store in room temperature , and consumed within less days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they taste of course , or in sweet food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a man@@ go also gives warm dishes a special note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it mild the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and wild . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther square
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of city President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino was bapti@@ sed on Wednesday , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill on the name of the German reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now known as &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Rome , the name of the Evangel@@ ical Churches was requested in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered that Protest@@ ants could only live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the place , in symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ ine , around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received the city at that time , as promised sin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his negative impressions might be able to strengthen him by historians in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Luther had initiated the split of the New Apostolic Church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works , the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible texts updated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , the word was the word ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now released with magnificent pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations with biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms , the 75 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old has been preserved - which is not equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , the respective issues can be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are cycles that are subject to topics such as cru@@ ising , pen@@ alties , commandments or father@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he has fascinated several partners , this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set itself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the selected Bible by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible , and then translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are embedded between the original Bible , Martin Luther and each one of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry band has golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education already happened with the pipe floor , is reminiscent of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art in faster than fast time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is embos@@ sed today , and that is noisy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symboli@@ sm is pushed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artists have a different desire and pleasure , to show things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures have always something secret , and are not decorative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to be able to discover and feel the viewer in the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; I like with his pictures life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old have not been taken to capture the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not co @-@ operation on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text is explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love , as well as the responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the origin@@ als , paper and linen images - will be presented in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place , place , company commissioned , pe@@ p@@ gel for a round course , one year later , was almost all finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in politics and administration in politics and administration , especially for families who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , hill above , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will be signed in October , the first community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to share in children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ li@@ ga continues a clear sign in the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football responds to the situation in Germany , and ensures the policy of its help with the associated problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep it for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say that , I have nothing to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to get every single interest to get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chancellor Office and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will be sure to play a central role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could help and wool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German football covenant has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program runs up to 2019 in the edge of the UEF@@ A session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some federal states support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine set a clear sign when they take place on the left Tri@@ ot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that all of them should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens sports chef Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller of the &quot; Image &quot; Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our beam power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already been so incredible , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ obvious hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ ur@@ ly spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the EM @-@ qualifying game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 lic@@ ences have started their own projects , be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as great , small and smallest clubs are active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we spent , will be lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and the next year , the Association together with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Committee loses an eye on the accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has been lost several reports by a overthrow of July the left eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen into a water@@ glass which he carried out in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost fal@@ seh@@ ood , has been terri@@ fied , and he told us last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go to his work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year old manager is in meeting with the meeting and &quot; fully unemployed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany and continue to the software concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to go to the public with such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; each one can happen something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand again , if you like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except vessels ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a corresponding photo and explained , he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown from the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a week , it comes as little as a reservation , Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus had finally sm@@ ashed in the first group of the Europe League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football Bundes@@ li@@ ga , with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its root eleven only on the R@@ eus position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he announced a change on the gate position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of tribal , novel brus@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe League games , Tu@@ chel left open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high probability , he will continue the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement of Mit@@ players R@@ eus , that the final train for BV@@ B in Europe League must be the goal , holds the middle field player Julian Wei@@ gl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to attack the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to be a leading role in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the will of the German Federal Government , Germany shall be the leader of the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Office decided on Wednesday a strategy from the house of traffic ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse Motor Show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and ensure less st@@ aves , do@@ ers said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to discuss the topic also with his official representatives from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives of industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the strategy of the transport Ministry emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band outlet and a rapid change on digital radio radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , the Federal Government intends to check the legal framework . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , Germany aims to use the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees the people as driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at automated driving , the car takes over the car the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process the data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after one of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the study will be highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 technically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles are still expected to expect from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany , the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the German self @-@ driving cars still see skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one on Wednesday , on the AA pre@@ determined survey of the For@@ sa Institute in the order of the For@@ sa Institute for the next ten years , 32 percent are expected only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of the survey amounted to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to leave itself completely on a self @-@ vehicle vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the digital verbal Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree that control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the highway you could imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic , in the St@@ au 45 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every Fourth would leave the car to control the control under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Düssel@@ dorfer aims to fight for the title of the title , from 25 September to 4 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision shall fall at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ tic Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 34 year old German Masters is expected to return on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no more so clearer Favor@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has moved to a serious violation of the right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the Defender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first diagnosis was awarded for 20 years old fellow players from Bas@@ tian pork to a sl@@ ur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday , in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highlights : window mannequins , thanks to video projections , look human . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and so that he plug men in tube . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant from Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was easy , now it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Mayor ) , which has changed from 18 September to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a lucky attitude towards a show over his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one dies , one comes into the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into that hardly visible work of the man , the fashion story , without ever completed an apprenticeship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic product for which much effort was operated : for example , a sty@@ list was engaged for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 tons of material used the Mach@@ ines according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the October , there was a special sciss@@ ors : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are shy than men , &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exhibition , Gau@@ l@@ ates old T@@ eddy can also be seen in the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ grav@@ y @-@ fashioned sket@@ ches of the designer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he used his T@@ eddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a doll , his parents had not allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the dec@@ eased of fashion he then brought himself to himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told his fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I bought it of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his first own fashion show , he cannot pay the models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they got nothing , but were not allowed to keep the cl@@ ots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ er tip as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it went to the long nitrogen machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops emerged in great quantity for customers , which they used for example to ceilings and curtains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ zz@@ ard P@@ lau@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the fashion is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the initial times of the P@@ lau@@ er tip , mode played a bigger role , then the home textile industry has been pushed out and is now discovered as a niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional tra@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects the past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , a growing potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is not operated in the textile industry in Germany , no longer is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ vements P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ er tip and embroi@@ dery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they may wear the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private shops and wholesale stores , there are almost no longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our products can hardly reach the customer on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , mass goods are produced much cheaper today in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the export of export , current to Russia and the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there are enough reasons for new ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt comple@@ ments : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and tips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to deal with the competition from the Asian room , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a voltage field between the most beautiful ideas of designers and companies that have to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design is often only varied to keep a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of a few years ago , Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter is newly renovated the historic snow@@ y tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the machine turns into a small kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ er gold@@ smith in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt was inspired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could start with traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a complex procedure , they character@@ ize the pattern in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the subject of P@@ lau@@ er tip - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and want to have a reminder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be able to stir , but Disney still dar@@ ed to a new film of his classics &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI to open the economy , the economy is wider to open the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open to the outside , to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was commissioned on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned by the steering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use foreign investment and know @-@ how to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how , he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new momentum to promote and reforms will lead to new momentum and vitality , offering new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including an Neg@@ ative list for the regulation of the market access , relaxation of the border controls , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies will not be identified for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system will be tested and tested by test programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance , since the market has a major role in the access of resources , a legally state business environment and the market is open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also control controls over the powers of the powers , and ensure that companies decide how to perform their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , other areas will be opened for private investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign financing companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to apply the requirements and the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and nationality , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders took part as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as in one after the meeting published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ors , and the consumers make a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who gave a corresponding work paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and effects of adverse industrial and environmental policy are passed with full force of pregnant and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve pois@@ oned for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or sciss@@ ors from &quot; economic policy &quot; is raised from one to two milli@@ gram mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , large predat@@ ors are already loaded with mercury that are not sold at the basis of the current limit values for about 50 percent of the length . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14@@ ,5 percent would be in@@ compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values at other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , referred to as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemetery fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore a per@@ fi@@ del@@ ity maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy @-@ toxic heavy metal for the people of highly toxic heavy metals , especially in predat@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low quantities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on his homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; health hazard of the general population is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly due to coal burning in the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information of the Federal Environment Ministry , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock took over six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings before mercury in fish are already the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
