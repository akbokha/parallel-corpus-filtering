&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are concluded in relation to the core material , when the community and the organisation determine that the material is consumed or in a manner dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is under the stand@@ point of the safety measures of Bel@@ ang , is no longer usable or virtually un@@ profitable . &quot;
the community mem@@ ori@@ zes the organisation according to this agreement the transfer of core material from the states that is subject to the safegu@@ ards following this agreement .
&quot; the safety measures after this agreement are completed in relation to the core material , as soon as the recipient of the recipient , as described in this agreement , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents , from which each passing and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if core material , the safety measures in accordance with this Convention , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , the fel@@ lowship is agreed with the organisation of such a use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures in accordance with this agreement can be concluded in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material during the duration of the non @-@ use of the safety measures after this Convention is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear det@@ erg@@ ents .
&quot; B ) The organisation and the community meet a regulation , that the securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention are not used as long as the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures planned in this Convention will once again be applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is maintained over the total amount and the composition of this material in the state or the states concerned , and on any passing of such material from that state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains her agreement as quickly as possible ; it only extends on matters such as time and proc@@ ed@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a sec@@ rec@@ y of the military activity , and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their authority , however , extraordinary costs as a result of a special investigation of the organisation , the organisation will refund the costs , provided that it is fully explained in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries out the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the organization &apos;s insp@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ensure that liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be taken to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with international law , any claim to the community or a state against the organization or the organization in relation to the community or state due to damage - except for damages from a nuclear incident - is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council after inspection of the relevant information provided by the General Director , that the organization is not able to ensure that no core material that has to be submitted to this Convention must be covered in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ ute , and , if applicable , the other measures will be taken . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained by the securing measures of certainty , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contrac@@ ting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organisation , community or state consult@@ ations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes in accordance with Article 19 or one of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement , which shall not be settled in the negotiation process or by another of the association , the Community and the States , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four so named refer@@ ees choose a fifth leading to the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States , or the organization within thirty days after the request for an arbit@@ ration , not the two refer@@ ees , the fel@@ lowship or organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is to be applied if within thirty days after the name or appointment of the fourth refer@@ ee , the fifth refer@@ ee has not been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Arb@@ it@@ ral Tribunal is competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Arb@@ it@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention occurs for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contrac@@ ting party of the treaty and members of the Community ( in force , i ) , if the relevant state of the organisation is noti@@ fied that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; II ) if the Community of the Organization is noti@@ fied that it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states cons@@ ulate each other on finding one of the contrac@@ ting parties about an amend@@ ment to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organisation , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director will immediately inform all Member States of the Organization immediately from any change of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs in force on the day of force , in which the organisation of the Community and the States shall receive written notification that their proceedings are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains as long as the states of the contrac@@ ting party are the contrac@@ ting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure required when performing the provisions of part I , on securing measures . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the securing measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bla@@ sting bodies for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a separation by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the technical inspection of the veri@@ fications by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity is not proven for a certain period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified seas . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their verification , the organisation according to Article 3 full use of the safety system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the suppl@@ ementary agreements . &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or in other way from the continu@@ ance removed from the continu@@ ance of core material and stock quantities ; &quot;
B ) Evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and measuring uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) procedures for assessment of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance , including inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se reports to the organisation in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures in accordance with this Convention are not based on materials in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit given under the letter c ) is not yet reached in the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves the core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit manufactured in the States , so it is subject to the safety measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this agreement are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in article 11 are not authorised , the community will consider that the recovery of core material , which is not possible or desired in Article 11 , is not possible or desired , so consult the organisation and community on the use of appropriate safegu@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures intended in this agreement are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and community agree that this core material is virtually un@@ profitable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ litt@@ able material when used in grams or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a nuclear material is rec@@ tified , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the organization core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures after this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards as long as the whole , due to this article in the states liber@@ ated the core material quantity at no point than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogra@@ m of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) U@@ ran with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ way square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and enriched ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) twenty metric tons of aged ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if liber@@ ated core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ ards after this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the safety measures will be taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of suppl@@ ementary agreements , which is required for the successful and effective creation of the tasks of the organisation according to this agreement , in the individual determining the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot;
the suppl@@ ementary agreements can be extended or altered without change of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization , based on the initial report stated in Article 62 , provides a summary of the complete inventory listing of the underlying core material in the states , ir@@ respective of its origin , and on the basis of the reports and results of its review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic co @-@ operation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ ent@@ ment problems .
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the Member States within six months following entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have consult@@ ed each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC organisation has presented a table , which is inten@@ tionally intended to apply the criteria defined in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establish@@ es a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds made by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special reaction account ; this account is used by the organisation as a car@@ et@@ aker , and , in accordance with the purpose defined in this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is separated separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , which is to be paid in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as the administrator of the special shareholder . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( and i ) the first at least 45 v . h .
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another time , agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every member state may request payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual methods of organisation , the administrator takes about proportional draw on cash or the school line to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to compens@@ ate for the special transaction account appropri@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; in case of the grant of this loan , the administrator can be derived from the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
&quot; III ) the scope , in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ; &quot;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ advantages ; and
&quot; VII ) the circum@@ ference , in which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot;
&quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the organisation financed by the organisation ( including the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction accounts may not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization during the day of in@@ vigor@@ ating this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization ; thus , in ten years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are rep@@ ay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the spraying process : first take away the paint , then the air ! &quot;
&quot; each Special Offer is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is specified . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and the following measures determined by the supervis@@ or at the time of loan grant , may be recipients of a special interest . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are carried out on the special transaction account , and in this manner the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be returned as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State . &quot;
&quot; the supervis@@ or , until the full disclosure of all the special requests , the E@@ EC will be informed by the directors in preparation and by the projects approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the payment of the special ac@@ credi@@ tation loan , the supervis@@ or supervis@@ es the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special issue loan and the expenses for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; the supervis@@ or convey@@ ed the E@@ EC as soon as possible after closing the financial year of the organisation , as soon as possible after completion of the company &apos;s financial year with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account . &quot;

the E@@ EC and the administrator are working closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the supervis@@ or to the full issue of the means of special reaction accounts for time @-@ to @-@ time exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction accounts , the progress of programmes or projects , and above all other questions relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; is this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organisation may be agreed not into force , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and referred back to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are concluded with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC , according to the legal regulations of each party . &quot;
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Council of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the Secretary @-@ General gives these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication about the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .

&quot; this program covers the creation of a large test facility , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company after chapter V of Eur@@ atom Treaty - referred to herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Shar@@ ed Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma map@@ hy@@ si@@ cs and is well familiar with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contrac@@ ting parties of the present agreement to consoli@@ date their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which have achieved higher priority levels due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement shall enable each contrac@@ ting party to make the most possible benefit through a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma map@@ hy@@ si@@ cs , to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and correspon@@ d@@ ingly to achieve the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electrical power generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties associate their respective research programmes in An@@ ne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program ac@@ quires long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time , if the parties assume a new program , this is the place of the programs listed in An@@ ne@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; in paragraph 1 , the association is realised by : - reasonable participation of each of the contrac@@ ting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of staff among the laboratories in the Eur@@ atom @-@ Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories outlined at the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- Right to access to scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; in the framework of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the implementation of the association agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties include an association agreement , referred to as &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those associated between the Commission and the states and companies or individuals referred to as &quot; association organs , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the timing of the agreement on the promotion of personnel ex@@ chang@@ ers , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is a member of the Joint Venture of J@@ ET , whose stat@@ ute is accepted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom agrees that Switzerland can contract contrac@@ tual partners each contract whose aim is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar agreements that are concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are commissioned with the implementation of the association intended in Articles 2 , 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement . &quot;

&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme , according to this agreement , is set to an amount that is at the expense of Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the Eur@@ atom participation in the Common Company as soon as this is built . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Eur@@ atom to finance the works within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which normally serves to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works performed on the basis of the relevant agreements . &quot;
the Commission will share the Bundesrat at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover the expendi@@ tures within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the respective year .
the Federal Council pays the commission due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .

&quot; blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ eled before sterili@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after completion of the blood removal , the bottle will be closed immediately and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; in terms of quantity , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to determine before hand of the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is determined by examining the blood cells in a new sample of don@@ or blood .

&quot; according to this agreement , blood is to be used only for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; the human whole blood is stored in ster@@ ile , closed bottle from micro @-@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during testing and transportation . &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the greatest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been extracted ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed . &quot;
&quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ered solution , which was added after the removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approximate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the assistance must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so on the label the volume and composition must be attached . &quot;
the human dry plasma is extracted through dehy@@ d@@ ration of the liquid that de@@ compos@@ es itself in cent@@ rifu@@ ging or sedi@@ mentation of human solid blood .
the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can be easily dissolved in a water quantity , which is equivalent to the amount of liquid that is used in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the solution may not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution may not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;

&quot; if plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours , steri@@ lity of each unit must be proven in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations , the signs of a bacter@@ ium contamination , are not used ; steri@@ lity of each donation must be proven in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transfer@@ ring I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis , plasma treatment may not be used more than 12 donations , or apply other methods , which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; the liquid quantity , from which one was dischar@@ ged during the production of plasma , must be dissolved ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If the solution is 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , co@@ ag@@ ulation is done ; the process can be accelerated in the bro@@ od furn@@ ace at 37 C . &quot;

&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a ster@@ ile , sealed bottle , under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of any moisture ; it is protected from light and keep on a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma cells are preparations from the protein component , which consist of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma of the human full blood . &quot;
&quot; without regard to whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must be heated up to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container for 10 hours to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G can be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the final product freeze dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the group is produced from human plasma cells as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of 45 to 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; comparison measurements of vis@@ cos@@ ity and clou@@ d@@ iness , as well as cent@@ rifu@@ ging with the ultra@@ cent@@ rifu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are carried out before and after heating to the solutions , are not allowed to indicate a den@@ atur@@ ation of the dissolved proteins . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ tier soli@@ ds in a mechanical bulk machine at this temperature , the solution must be completely free from visible particles . &quot;
I ) The counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing tests with specific Anti@@ sera must show that in both preparations only human plasma proteins are contained ;
&quot; ( II ) the electro@@ phor@@ esis is represented by free @-@ floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that the protein fra@@ ction , which possesses the mot@@ ility of the alb@@ umin@@ ous component of normal human plasma , has to be at least 95 % in preparation from human plasma concentrations at least 85 % of the protein mass . &quot;
&quot; in other preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in and in fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins , sodium concentration 0.0@@ 15 mo@@ l per litre solution or re @-@ produced tro@@ ugh gro@@ wer may not exceed 0,@@ 15 mo@@ l per liter solution . &quot;

a reaction to blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the body or another on the label .
&quot; if a reaction is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the Tit@@ anium is measured by ever renewed di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent to double in a suitable medium .
the Tit@@ er is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cells in total volume .
&quot; anti @-@ A , anti @-@ b or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;

&quot; if a reaction is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required characteristics should remain for at least one year . &quot;
the decline date of a reag@@ ent in a fluctu@@ ating form according to label is at most a year after the last satis@@ factory efficacy test .
&quot; the expi@@ ration date on the label , which is attached to the label on the label , is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; dry @-@ re@@ agen@@ zien are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ tial gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; a dry reaction may lose at most 0,5 D. H. of its weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authorities determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic is added , as long as the reag@@ ent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the reag@@ ents , in@@ different , whether in a fluctu@@ ating form or after re@@ petition , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;

&quot; reag@@ ents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the reag@@ ent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the quantity must be so large , that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written written records on all levels of production and controls of the reag@@ ents for blood group determination .
&quot; appropriate samples of all reag@@ ents issued are to be stored in the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; reag@@ ents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintenance of the reag@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups after the origin of their active part . &quot;
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
&quot; each container is black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
