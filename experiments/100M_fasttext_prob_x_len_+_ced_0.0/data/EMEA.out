the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Department ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the trials conducted for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) have assessed the studies carried out in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you wish for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ections solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ma@@ dness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic condition , in which the patients have a normal mood altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the inj@@ ections solution will be used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if oral dosage is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used to take or use the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who simultaneously take other medicines , same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to interact with each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in a lower degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; because dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or physical symptoms and prevent their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ections solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered an increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients , with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered an increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significant increase in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled twit@@ ching ) , ac@@ ath@@ ema ( continuous movement ) , trem@@ ors , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly male episodes and their man@@ ic episodes linked to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day in a daily dosage of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acc@@ entu@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; when treated with abili@@ fy treat signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in cases associated with sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosing and response to unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ene , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; because of the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is recommended when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ tes , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should get advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to insufficient data storage for people and due to the concerns raised in the re@@ productive studies of the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including strength vehicles to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the inci@@ dence of the effects below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were treated with a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ema , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % was treated with patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term period of 26 weeks with a plac@@ ebo controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zu@@ res , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed only in adult patients with este@@ emed doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg , and without death . &quot;
&quot; there is no information about the efficacy of a ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose is beneficial because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depression Scale Scale , showed a significant improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significant reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % was under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of approx . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a soli@@ dity effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , like lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic interventions , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ li@@ ation by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean el@@ min@@ ation focal length is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metaboli@@ tes via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ tes via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh grade A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the influence of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity during repeated exposure , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ v@@ asive potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data left no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se @-@ toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the elimination of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ aboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs to release single cans made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 Late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 Late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia performing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 34 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day in a daily dosage of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can take the processed tablets alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is part of psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia performing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consci@@ ous@@ nesses and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should get advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :

&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consci@@ ous@@ nesses and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ene , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the inci@@ dence of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was applied as one @-@ time indication intra@@ mus@@ cular , while the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intra@@ mus@@ cular . &quot;

&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C after receiving the same dose as tablet , the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time was to reach the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cular . &quot;

&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity during repeated exposure , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the can@@ v@@ asive potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data left no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al channel toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ c@@ ine loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) .

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters were previously an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a single dose or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the use of a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; considering only patients who were treated for the first time for metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between drug efficacy and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who previously received other treatment of their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be applied to patients , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ cal numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel @-@ related medicines , it has to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients where first @-@ line treatment for metast@@ atic disease is missing , and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine contained therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ es &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neuro@@ path@@ y grade 3 , the treatment is interrupted until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function were performed and there is currently no adequate data to advise dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the use of children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article form@@ ulation by pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ cal number is risen again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ st number is risen again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly defined car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ative remedi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ eption method .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment is no child to witness . &quot;
male patients should be advised before treatment through a sem@@ en preservation because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects are reported , associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 78@@ 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orous in the blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in the blood of heart disease : &quot;

pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active which promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules out of the tubes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ arization .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of alb@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was supported by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sp@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ tor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation in the area of the tum@@ our occurs .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two Phase III studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III trial study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centr@@ alised study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel for 3 weeks either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % of metast@@ atic and 19 % for metast@@ atic and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for general response rate and time until the disease progression as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy , are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving a grade for patients who experienced a peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plas@@ ma@@ flux decreased in a multi @-@ phase mode . &quot;
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or white bond of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ uble pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
&quot; the clearing of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel @-@ injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine is 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the owners of the approval for the market launch the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : &quot;
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing instruction . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drugs &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which blood trans@@ fusion may occur if a blood @-@ trans@@ fusion is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with ab@@ sen@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter of adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the whole treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ sen@@ amed was compared with 4@@ 79 patients with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , compared with reference drugs . &quot;
&quot; at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein at least eight weeks before they were either killed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

the company also carried out the results of a study involving the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from the an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ sen@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of ab@@ sen@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ sent@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; ab@@ sen@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions will be triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ sen@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union of evidence , the medicine has a similar quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fu@@ sions in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant ly@@ mph@@ omas or multi@@ plex my@@ el@@ oma receiving chemotherapy and the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , for planned larger surgical procedures that demand a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the blood pressure , ab@@ sen@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can not be applied to a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and consequences may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in to more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values may occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose @-@ management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is necessary for controlling an@@ emia and an@@ emia . &quot;
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; initial dose of 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose @-@ management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is necessary for controlling the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at least 1@@ g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised three times a week three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value for ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , with which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ uts is necessary , ab@@ sent@@ amed should be given twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
&quot; the iron @-@ substitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , which will provide great iron reserves before the start of the de@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given 300 I.@@ U. / kg each subsequent days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in circulation . &quot;
patients suffering under the treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin on an er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast stop ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia or PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ sen@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ sta@@ sis ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lusion , vas@@ cular disease of car@@ ot@@ id or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a recently in@@ experienced heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months after years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden potential loss , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need of trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ escence , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten Index ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and investigate the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ sen@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 Pati@@ ents with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 Recommen@@ ded upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration .
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ant agents ( ESA ) were given to a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ite rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ fied cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gestive heart failure should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 Recommen@@ ded upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in case of tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ fu@@ ded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment of the patient &apos;s involvement which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , before the start of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger electro@@ surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be excluded that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hardness of &gt; 13 g / dl there may be an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tum@@ our patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ our progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that received chemotherapy returned if a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 @-@ 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis can be adjusted to the rising hem@@ atom@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tum@@ our tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differenti@@ ation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al I@@ FC , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular attacks ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ emic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides , and is identical with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine in the urine . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ om@@ es , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ - ly@@ mph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ vo@@ irs ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ y@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; in 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 8@@ 02 patients with ha@@ vo@@ ids . &quot;
survival and tum@@ our progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo controlled trials .
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ancies , significantly higher mort@@ ality than controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in inci@@ dence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients and controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ lic events in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than ser@@ um levels , which are achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ tism or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In the experimental studies with nearly the 20 @-@ fold increase of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced fet@@ al body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports support in vitro results with cells from human tum@@ our tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store un@@ se@@ amed once for a period of 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and fill volume is indicated by an adhesive label , so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
treatment with ab@@ sent@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded at the recommended upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration in Section 4.2 .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ite rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport sector has to supply medical specialist personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Con@@ clu@@ sion of the product characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing instruction . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport sector has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is described in Version 3.0 and is functional before the medicine is taken into circulation , and as long as it is used in the transport of pharmaceuticals . &quot;

&quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Rehabilitation products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , PS@@ UR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • If you receive new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , or measures to reduce risk reduction targets • by promp@@ ting the EMEA &quot;
&quot; • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina P@@ ect@@ or@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of a blood pl@@ ump may occur in the v@@ eins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lusion ) , the neck vas@@ cular occ@@ lusion ( vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ ot@@ id ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with ab@@ sen@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a mild dose @-@ dependent increase in blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be taken into account and be treated prior to treatment . &quot;
very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tic@@ ular er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast stop@@ enia after months after years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast stop@@ enia , it will break your therapy with ab@@ sen@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ab@@ sen@@ amed must be given to a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in may be the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or rising pot@@ assi@@ um levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ sen@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically exposed cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gestion by insufficient cardiac output , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood ar@@ mis@@ ion with ab@@ sen@@ amed in adults with chronic ren@@ al weakness ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for the evaluation of the effectiveness of ab@@ sen@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ sen@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully balanced against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ en@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that ab@@ sen@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may affect the tumor in certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orth@@ op@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get ab@@ sen@@ amed since there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other drugs or have taken / applied recently / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( mean to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor will be prescribed certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , e.g. cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood ar@@ mo@@ sis ( an@@ emia ) is on the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be prescribed regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ sen@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will be prescribed regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how an@@ emia is on the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ itt@@ le ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as when falling asleep ; • Mor@@ bus pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus pass at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection into a muscle prior to the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ l@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ l@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that blocks bone substance ) in the blood re @-@ norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients in Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under@@ went a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under Plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion center and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta manufactures re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta for treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended twice or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus pa@@ get with ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after applying acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
patients with kidney dys@@ function ( see Section 4.4 ) In Pati@@ ents with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ up@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ l@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is lacking in safety and efficacy .
ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated prior to treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of zinc cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be used before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available , whether the break of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the inci@@ dence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the inci@@ dence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients who received Ac@@ tem@@ ra ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .

&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ desirable drug interactions are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dys@@ function of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were expressed as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ l@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after treatment was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to patients with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal sw@@ elling range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently experienced hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion center such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was seen , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ phi@@ es ( primary in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including zinc cit@@ ric acid . &quot;

ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared with plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ l@@ sta showed a consistent impact over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density in lum@@ bar acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with the plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip of 6.@@ 7 % , the lum@@ bar weight by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ otic patients were treated with ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken out of the pel@@ vic . &quot;
a micro@@ computer@@ tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study period . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ l@@ sta declined significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;

the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ l@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens Ac@@ l@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly mild to moderate @-@ moderate Mor@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um levels of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.2 times the age @-@ specific upper average for inclusion into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in comparison to taking 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed compared to the bas@@ eline value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as a respon@@ dent at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained during a medium duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ ed independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % to 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ phase van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ale elimination period of ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages of distribution ( α and β ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; total body clearance amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of zinc acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration vs. time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clearing by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zinc is not metaboli@@ zed by humans , and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450 - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients under@@ went 84 ± 29 m@@ L / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dys@@ function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate acid .
&quot; as for severe kidney function disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only available data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non lethal dose of intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ ft of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate was administ@@ ered in rats by 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals . in dogs a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion was administ@@ ered in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological and anti@@ stress effects of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to lower ser@@ um calcium levels .

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ strate class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the murder of bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made out of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get , bone reconstruction becomes too fast , and new bone material is made un@@ ordered , which weak@@ ens the bone material than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by restor@@ ing bone reconstruction , thereby restor@@ ing normal bone formation and gives the bones more strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other drugs or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ l@@ sta together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you should take enough liquid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor and after treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nur@@ ses as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus pa@@ get the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administ@@ ered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta has a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium @-@ mirror in your blood is not too low in your blood . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before termination of treatment with Ac@@ l@@ sta If you are considering ending the treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after ac@@ la@@ sta administration . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ l@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
&quot; before and after the ac@@ la@@ sta administration , patients must be treated adequ@@ ately with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of zinc cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , continuous , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure adequate supply of calcium , at least twice daily 500 m@@ g. of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of Ac@@ l@@ sta . &quot;

Summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Department ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the trials conducted for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) have assessed the studies carried out in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) where Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) is not indicated .
&quot; it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ etic acid or insulin , the current dose of sul@@ phon@@ etic acid or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utili@@ sed and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ ine resin , in addition , they received either acet@@ one or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo was reduced to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients was examined , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ der@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin , and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable because of contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in the reports of heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; when the AL@@ T mirrors are lifted up to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible to control again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms related to a hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzy@@ mes are checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be conducted before the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fat deposits and in some cases connected with a fluid retention .
&quot; as a consequence of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients who receive pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the inci@@ dence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma was reported with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , if patients complain about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of more than 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or entering it , the treatment should be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ ox@@ ins , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal are reduced and thus reduce the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( of the present data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic properties . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ ne@@ sts were compared to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the normal range compared to plac@@ ebo , but less rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1,6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on res@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; since the launch has been widely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , however , when Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials have been carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the group treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures appeared at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day had no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core rec@@ ept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ amine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after the treatment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months ) .
&quot; after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite the three @-@ month phase of insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for a year , in Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ves showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in output values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ le gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was found , while Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or plac@@ ebo for a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the highest concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to the effectiveness of the three @-@ fold of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ ox@@ ins , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma el@@ min@@ ation focal length of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all active metaboli@@ tes are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with ha@@ em@@ el@@ ution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal reduces and thus reduce the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in increased inci@@ dence of colon@@ os@@ copy . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of more than 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials more than 1 year , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and also hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was lacking in terms of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study of more than 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were similar to other insulin levels . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes are out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection pin must be in@@ hibited at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has significantly improved through intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms can be seen and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phas@@ ely , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required in patients with a dose adjustment , this may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic responses after a change of animal insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such travels can cause insulin and meals to be applied to other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and will always consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to consciousness and / or var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zu@@ res and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have diabetes , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum peak is achieved within 2 @-@ 8 hours and the overall duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of sp@@ litt@@ ing ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human ins@@ ul@@ ina molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the division is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity during repeated exposure , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already shown signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or crow@@ ns ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter , the dose can be increased once a day at 120 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis can occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ cris@@ y ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol was used at a dose of once a day 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients , who once daily 120 mg daily , had a urine acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart defects in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ a@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the history known or currently present , or / or a rheum@@ atism ) . &quot;
&quot; if the acid @-@ acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase to A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily may be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ tra Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents As there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ac@@ id@@ ative drugs , it can occur during the treatment of acute rheum@@ atism , because of the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al level first ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; for example , in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical studies have been observed slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function measured with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to carry out a liver function before the beginning of the Feb@@ u@@ ary treatment and in the further course of clinical findings and a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ gram was not performed any interaction studies to Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; subjects were associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ d / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without having a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously used other active ingredient .

&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or to exercise hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , a number of higher inci@@ dence reported by the investig@@ ator reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at was found . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events occurring in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ary treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are at the same time treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extensions in open long @-@ term extensions were 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;
the events reported during long @-@ term long @-@ term extensions were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ary stat@@ e- treatment groups more than once , and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extensions ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information . &quot;
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 , either at all or with a lower frequency : &quot;

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients , with which the last three month @-@ specific ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were used . &quot;
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ atine value at the beginning of the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional used dose of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol 300 mg .

the reduction of the phosph@@ or@@ us acid level to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment . &quot;
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX @-@ study assessed efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restri@@ ction ( D ) .
&quot; with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 extension study showed that less than 3 % of the patients needed a treatment against a compensation ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a thr@@ ust ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ nipp@@ le size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out knots up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ inol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extensions ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plas@@ ma@@ flux Time @-@ Cur@@ ve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administ@@ ering simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; plasma treatment of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes are predominantly made by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ u@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged February ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair were also found as unchanged February ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups cardi@@ opul@@ mon@@ ary in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine@@ Met@@ aboli@@ zation and ur@@ inary composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in crop performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;

&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 have already been used in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data that came from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE regarding increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who took only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also suggested that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the mus@@ cul@@ ature ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the di@@ gestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , sp@@ her@@ ical ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , sp@@ her@@ ical abdom@@ en ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , sti@@ cky abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in patients with some hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in disorders of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of pharmaceuticals ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE should be swal@@ lowed up after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ob@@ liter@@ al reactions , such as aut@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partial were these severe and required hospit@@ alisation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor therefore should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant responses , and patients should be advised to take the medicine in case of symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or , according to the occurrence of symptoms related to mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions can be passed to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , it was rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regime includes intra@@ ven@@ ously administ@@ ered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether the treatment of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure may reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment plan for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet next morning after taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE after taking notice of their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated adequ@@ ately before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical studies with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only fores@@ een for the application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not give any indication of directly damaging effects in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports are reported by cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , deposits of ser@@ um calcium to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate sequence of oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f is administ@@ ered to adult patients , who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients , in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been conducted and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with some hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects including under@@ - or hyper@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the form@@ ulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be carried out under the strict supervision of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a consequence of a switch to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood @-@ reflecting regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
&quot; after switching from programming to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ k@@ mirror should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , systemic exposure was compared to a valley level , with both form@@ ulations both in both ni@@ er@@ y- and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the direct transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the adv@@ agram can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral dosage of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection needs to maintain immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection of the oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments can be necessary later , as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dose recommendation - Rel@@ ation from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agram , a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules can be converted to a daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis recommended for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection has to begin .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recipients , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in l@@ ung@@ - , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients , came in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ function in patients with severe liver dys@@ function .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ in level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ision and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ance At the change@@ over from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the whole blood dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dam controls .
&quot; it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after programming on Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentrations ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State interven@@ ed . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the seb@@ um levels in the blood are 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tal@@ low of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the form@@ ulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be carried out under mes@@ h@@ ly control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy @-@ resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the re@@ tar@@ ded form@@ ulation advance . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedi@@ es during treatment with adv@@ ancement ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is recommended as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which may also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ function , infections , hy@@ d@@ ration and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , are particularly recommended in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es , known as inhibit@@ ors or inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous application of substances that can alter the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ lid @-@ Antibiot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effects on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs that can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are taken . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and prolon@@ gs its half @-@ life .
&quot; the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not provide evidence that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and high bond to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the compound in the cell inn@@ aker .
this results in a cal@@ ci@@ um dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a particular series of ly@@ mph@@ oma genes .

the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .

&quot; Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a deficiency of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application depend on whether Adv@@ ance is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into which it em@@ powers it to the formation of the human ger@@ minal factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union , called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was assessed . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human ger@@ ms factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of Adv@@ ances throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is pre@@ valent .
&quot; during the treatment course , to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections , appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ti@@ cks is recommended . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , reaching different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times . &quot;
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity is not reached , or if the bleeding is not ma@@ stered with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be directed to the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;

&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation is no experience . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the total of the individual patients ( 234 ) .
&quot; blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in plasma and the clearing rate showed adequate values on the 15th post@@ operative day . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ GW , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ GW a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , no one of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms attached to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ GW &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company with@@ draws its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , bones or wed@@ ges ( tissues that link other structures in the body are affected and supported ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can bear a gene in the body &apos;s cells .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 @-@ protein produced from the non @-@ def@@ ective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to restore damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the lower part , in bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial submitted documents , CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not enough to prove that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company did not have sufficient evidence that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company was not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changes in substance release , &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by allergi@@ es against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are covered . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be followed by con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported receiving the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , about a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under@@ went a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % to 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the decrease in the sw@@ elling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ s such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned r@@ hin@@ ol@@ ei@@ c ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective , and the data do not submit to appropriate recommendations for dosing . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ function and the data do not suff@@ ice to express appropriate recommendations for dosing .
&quot; patients need to be informed that the treatment of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be set off . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder hal@@ ide reconstruction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences between the patients with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients could be detected regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , so interactions with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ security of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregnant women , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the inci@@ dence of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since re@@ productive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ al procedures . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult micro tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , breathing , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ y , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin conditioning , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the gain of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flies . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , where 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the total number of symptoms ( except nas@@ al sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the two weeks treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equ@@ ilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 . &quot;

a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to a dose of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity during repeated exposure , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot be recognized for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in re@@ productive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and ra@@ bb@@ its in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; tell your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze following symptoms or diseases : • High blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken drugs , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; use in recommended dosage is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness , or dimin@@ ishes the attention . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ atics , you should immediately inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten your dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and contact the next dose at the scheduled date . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the mentioned side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects , which are not stated in this use information . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves r@@ ash and sw@@ elling ) or skin r@@ ashes were reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach complaints , diarr@@ he@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , anxiety attacks , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous liver values was also very rare . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate for intake ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by modi@@ fying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body makes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies have been taken , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms of symptoms ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline of the symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to use Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease course and can be res@@ umed after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week , more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be recommended during the allergy season . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol have not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth tum@@ ors ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administ@@ ered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measuring parameters of the flu@@ idity including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ sist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as with the total volume of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , ir@@ respective of eti@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ ines are a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies more than 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US reduced the disorder of sleep and awareness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
no indication for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) exceeds 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; in vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hi@@ bits C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose @-@ study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 m@@ g. meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity during repeated exposure , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot be recognized for the human being . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ aller@@ genic , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support a treatment of infected r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
&quot; in addition to exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and experience higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , fully metaboli@@ sed , is identical to the children who metaboli@@ se normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administ@@ ered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol have not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall inci@@ dence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup @-@ group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 who came into question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dosage of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , which was applied daily over 14 days in a dosing of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor skills . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a gain of alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and juven@@ ile patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the total volume of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the symptoms caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies more than 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indication for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient @-@ cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) more than 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate dose can be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was used in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the gain of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as with the total volume of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population were comparable , 4 % of patients were achieved higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. has officially announced that the company with@@ draws its application for the transfer of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that should be protected from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from human to human because humans have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administ@@ ering the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to make contact with a flu virus of this pedi@@ ms faster anti@@ body . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a body foreign ) has been puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as a part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA &apos;s guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you wish for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immune deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , it is available as a solution for inclusion , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor tested what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , combined with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ alized reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus further delay the development of infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with a low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 48 weeks , more patients had a virus last under 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but with the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few were talking to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a may not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a must also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are used as as@@ ep@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines to treat HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune reaction syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ generating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was given . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ a in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
usually A@@ generic capsules should be administ@@ ered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out using the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ s@@ ules and Solution to take on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules may be applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ s@@ ules in adult patients with moderate liver function was reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dys@@ function to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
simultaneous application should be carried out with caution when patients with severe liver dys@@ function are contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ at@@ or or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver failure with potentially lethal outcome .
&quot; for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing limited liver function including chronic hep@@ atitis indicate an increased inci@@ dence of liver dys@@ function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the ingredients concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ a can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col@@ o@@ co@@ y of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this form of dosage is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 , if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an indication of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that medications were needed to connect with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
oph@@ thal@@ mic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors lie reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atom@@ as and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were particularly reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose agents are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled through the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already taken the St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ ene is and , if possible , to check the virus load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily ) combined with am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rite on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg of Lop@@ ar avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg of Lop@@ ar avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA may not be given , however , it is recommended to monitor closely monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed using di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the anta@@ geous component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ a are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rite avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustments are necessary . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is recommended as del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on dol@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus leads to a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ a is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ a in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plas@@ ma@@ ids of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of two times daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ra@@ viol@@ i and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ piece ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without any simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ a can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) more than 7 days of volunteers , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plas@@ ma@@ therapy increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ des , unless the potential benefit of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , increases in plasma levels are expected at simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ubar@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the same time as am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while cau@@ tious with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma levels by 3 to 4 fa@@ eces .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of op@@ ium withdrawal , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ ical effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in con@@ current offering of A@@ gener@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r affects the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by logging in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight at night . &quot;
the further development of desc@@ endants including fertility and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by administ@@ ering am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernity unit .
the in@@ security of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to the treatment break . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether it is related to taking A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment , or if it is a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were scored by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study media , and with more than 1 % of the patients performed , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ inting fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation ( stit@@ ches ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din , a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ LINE 300@@ 6 study , patients treated with 245 NR@@ TI@@ - treated in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ule nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily with low dos@@ ed ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the inci@@ dence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K levels were comparable ; an exception was the increase in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which in patients who received A@@ gener@@ a together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient has to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ Pol@@ yst@@ s with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ ossi@@ b@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on avi@@ r doses were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ stered treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;
&quot; in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 closed cases with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V ,
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be applied in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rite or rite ra@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ b@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resi@@ stances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients , in which a fossil vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e ( one of them pointed out a resistance to Lop@@ ar avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early demolition of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day based on the trial PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial involving PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included into the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ lexi@@ veness of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the plasma after 16 weeks in the plasma after 16 weeks .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed rite avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s administ@@ ered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food was influenced by the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; pren@@ avi@@ r is made from a solution of 14 % less bio@@ degra@@ dable than of the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ a solution and A@@ gener@@ a capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rite cavi@@ ties . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who can be achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , correspon@@ ded . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test , micro @-@ core test on rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ant nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at a age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules may be applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rite cavi@@ ar ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dys@@ function , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the ingredients concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily ) combined with am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg of Lop@@ ar avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA may not be given , however , it is recommended to monitor closely monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on dol@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ a will be recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) more than 7 days of volunteers , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plas@@ ma@@ therapy increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ ical effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ an@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by logging in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the in@@ security of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient has to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered as expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss till C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - x ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at a age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabolism paths are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r or other critical constitu@@ ents of the form@@ ulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion was not proven either with PI pre@@ treated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ s@@ ules and Solution to take on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col@@ o@@ co@@ y , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to intake in small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ at@@ or or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , are available methods to determine the ingredients concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be dis@@ continued if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
oph@@ thal@@ mic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors lie reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atom@@ as and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily ) combined with am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ a can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data to 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ gener@@ a solution may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ ol@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r affects the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by logging in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the in@@ security of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether it is related to taking A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment , or if it is a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ ossi@@ b@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on avi@@ r doses were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ stered treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;
early canc@@ er@@ ation of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large ve@@ al volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism underlying the gen@@ ome of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

&quot; your doctor will usually advise you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , to strengthen the effect of A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
the use of A@@ gener@@ a is based on the individual viral resistance test performed by your doctor for you and your treatment pre@@ history .
tell your doctor if you suffer from one of the above diseases or take any of the above @-@ mentioned drugs .
&quot; if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ a capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure you have carefully read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before the treatment starts . &quot;
&quot; similarly , there are no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ a capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effectiveness of children aged between 4 and 12 years or generally in patients less than 50 kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is important to read the section &quot; &quot; Using A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you need additional factor VIII to control the a@@ version of bleeding . − In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease being treated : • In case of inc@@ lin@@ ation in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks twice a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin areas , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about 8 hours ) on the skin before washing . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with warts in the genital area of 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks , al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete sever@@ ity of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all trials , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immune @-@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible bow@@ ls have disappeared in the genital or Peri@@ an@@ al@@ tic area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 @-@ 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient would like to apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed it and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the puri@@ fied , with inc@@ lin@@ able skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and associated risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily physi@@ ological san@@ itation was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ li@@ osis and one case with one to circum@@ c@@ ision were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed in rare cases , which have necess@@ itated a treatment and / or resulted in temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; in order to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous means for treatment of external co@@ wards in the genital and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ gia , no clinical experience has been performed . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of inc@@ lin@@ ary reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in relation to the elimination of co@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; since there are no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likelihood of response to im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ic areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally occur in the course of treatment on intensity or go back after setting up therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause severe dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions have less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after mal@@ ign@@ ant top@@ ical application of ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation may be given during bre@@ ast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most common and probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the location of the treatment of inc@@ lin@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most frequent reported and possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème in the related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
the side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream treated with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , the review of clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème often resulted in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Exc@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / sli@@ pping ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the review of clinical signs shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème is very common to severe issues ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and short@@ ening ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental inclusion of 200 mg is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increased systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines .
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete eradi@@ cation of the inc@@ lin@@ ation in an im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the patients treated 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine patients , the co@@ wards were completely healed ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete breakdown could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five @-@ week application for six weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .

&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic act les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the annual data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external inc@@ lin@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ conduc@@ tive bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a creme was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine spread through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly usage , during 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ tered 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable pack ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ sick skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to the healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super fibro@@ us bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out four months in the der@@ mal application did not have similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at der@@ mat@@ ogen@@ ous administ@@ ering three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application area .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and does not mut@@ ate , there is a risk for people due to systemic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice , which was treated with the effective free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the mentioned side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use @-@ information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous lifetime . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied with flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is best suited for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with co@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; O If you previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor before starting with the treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream until you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void your contact with eyes , lips and nose mu@@ c@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; if you have inter@@ course during infection with inc@@ lin@@ ts in genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual inter@@ course ( not previously ) is performed . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently been applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
bre@@ ast@@ feeding your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is not known because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od passes into breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are different in co@@ wards , bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer Al@@ dar@@ a cream onto the clean , dry skin with the bow@@ ls and ru@@ b the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
men with bow@@ ls under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 ) What do you have to notice before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that Al@@ dar@@ a &apos;s effect is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks each week , a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream will apply to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a creme , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a lower number of blood cells can make you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain from you faster or it can cause deposits .
&quot; tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this use information . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually it is easier skin reactions , which , within about 2 weeks after setting up the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , sw@@ elling , sh@@ ear formation , skin irrit@@ ation , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , G@@ AG@@ s ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements more difficult , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with res@@ ection devices , and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzy@@ mes in patients with a secure diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat neuro@@ logical manifestation of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ plac@@ ements for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience regarding res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a prolonged inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data in new@@ born inf@@ ants exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to bre@@ ast@@ feed with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants below 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension in 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in the following table : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ associated participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe form of follow @-@ up and a duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version , during the age of 5 years , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version was observed ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ i@@ fac@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic . &quot;
patients with failed to low anti@@ body levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in the urine while in patients with high anti@@ body bodies a variable decrease of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to a small neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ strate , and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzy@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me referred to the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected prospective FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
the 26 patients with hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first four weeks , a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was found that remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous clinical manifestation of the patients , which was taken into account by the use of a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variable ( expected to be expected to be expected to be improved in 6 minutes ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe form of follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development speed ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe follow @-@ up form were limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme of 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a substitute alternative , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to the patients affected in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated dietary and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except the ones listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C when di@@ lution is controlled under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;

&quot; within the given period , the holder of author@@ isation for the transport sector has completed the following program programme , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients who have been treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , is either absent in a small amount or this enzyme is missing . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurred with you .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , tell your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken drugs , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application , and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical personnel ) . &quot;
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient is wearing this , gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very often ( inci@@ dence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • Skin r@@ ash • Joint Disease , Joint Pain , Back Pain , Pain in the arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • Hyper@@ tension • Less Ox@@ y@@ gen in Blood • Response to the In@@ fusion Center &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package insert will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C when di@@ lution is controlled under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent bottles .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) , or &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been treated , combined with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( vitamin B@@ 12 ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent dehy@@ d@@ ration ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , reduced or reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of telem@@ etry s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells to divide . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of telem@@ etry into its active form is more easily done in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study in 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study to 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells , during which A@@ lim@@ ta was administ@@ ered longer survival times than with the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in case of over@@ sized plate epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with systemic metast@@ atic or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) administ@@ ers as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of K@@ OF as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of telem@@ etry in@@ fusion during the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of K@@ OF is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the telem@@ etry administration and the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ tera , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need an intra@@ mus@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g. ) during the week prior to the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving telem@@ etry , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place under consideration - the N@@ adi@@ s of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to directions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy should be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient passes the value prior to treatment &quot;
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 dose reduction , hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 or so@@ - continue at the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials did not indicate that in patients aged 65 years , or over 65 years , an increased inci@@ dence of inci@@ dence was increased . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the use of children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min . &quot;
the data location in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored in terms of bone @-@ related suppression and telem@@ etry may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ st number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as reported in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ologic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was considered , if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 was taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore all patients need to be treated with telem@@ etry , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measures to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treated toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy .
&quot; all patients , for which therapy with telem@@ etry , have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room , a drainage of the erg@@ ometer prior to the emet@@ re treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 main cardiovascular events including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported occasionally , if this substance was usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated dietary supplements ( excluding yellow fever , this vacc@@ ine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity is carried out by telem@@ etry , men should be advised before the treatment procedure to obtain advice regarding the sem@@ en preservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ al@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and less than 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application with telem@@ etry should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telem@@ etry . &quot;
the major in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ la@@ sty chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of telem@@ etry in pregnant women , but as with male an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; telem@@ etry may not be used during pregnancy except if it is mandatory , and after careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity by means of telem@@ etry , men should be advised before the start of the treatment . &quot;
it is not known whether telem@@ etry is transmitted to breast milk and unwanted effects in the bre@@ ast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and telem@@ etry was random@@ ized as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dence indication : very often ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 und &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 und &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 und &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 und &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( &lt; 1 / 10000 ) and not known ( based on the available data from spont@@ an@@ eity ) . &quot;
* * * Be@@ aten to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should be reported from the term &quot; kid@@ neys / gen@@ it@@ al@@ tract others . &quot; * * * Be@@ en to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should be reported from the term &quot; kid@@ neys / gen@@ it@@ al@@ tract others . &quot; * * * Be@@ en to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should be reported only as degree 1 or 2 .

&quot; it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square in combination with low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t metaboli@@ se some fats in food , which makes about a quarter of the fats supplied un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with stu@@ d finish , chair class , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , descending straight sections ( fur ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ches ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the di@@ gestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or bre@@ ast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
all@@ i must not be applied to children and adolescents under 18 because there are insufficient data for effectiveness and safety .
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ated , older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function are not adap@@ ting the dosage . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or one of the other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Par@@ ent treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the likelihood of emergence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or obes@@ e diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before the start of therapy . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicine against high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to make additional floating @-@ related measures to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea failure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in multiple cases with con@@ current application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to supplement suppl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations before bed@@ time , to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the application of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of taken fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of known adverse events identified after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported by a population of uncertain size .
&quot; it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i leads to conver@@ sions in terms of possible , or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days on normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , from a rapid recovery of the systemic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ pas@@ h@@ ous properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine , the therapeutic effect is associated with the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ stro and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es . &quot;
&quot; derived from clinical trials , 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the modification of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , a metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only spor@@ adi@@ cally and be detected in very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , the minimum systemic res@@ or@@ ated dose was administ@@ ered , two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after division of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , identified approximately 42 % of total plastic concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity during repeated exposure , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular danger for humans . &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal doesn &apos;t contain any fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking the capsule in combination with a meal containing too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body in the new eating habits , you are already beginning first capsule collection with a low cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
nutrition key books are effective since you can easily understand what you eat as much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
&quot; to ensure your target weight is safe , you should set two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the likelihood of diet @-@ related symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • Do you want to move more , before you start taking the capsules . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of capsules , resulting in more fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment , as at this time you may not have reduced fat in your diet yet . &quot;
&quot; • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions , which you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know exactly how much you eat , the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit . &quot;

over@@ weight has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing different serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • diabetes • Cardi@@ ac disease • Cer@@ tain@@ ly canc@@ ers • Cer@@ tain@@ able canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to live permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication on food packaging . &quot;
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , take out the information below which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • The capsule &apos;s mode of operation is crucial to maintaining the recommended fat intake . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this means that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the likelihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; 34 These dimin@@ ished cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight gradually and continuously improve approximately 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep it in mind . &quot;
the all@@ i program for the support of weight loss combines capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information material that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group do not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the substance is linked to a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to rec@@ ept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined to 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Hel@@ icop@@ ter Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ itted chemotherapy , due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ is to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ b@@ ular ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered with con@@ current offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or prolon@@ ging the Q@@ T interval or which tends to become such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to other chemotherapy drugs , Alo@@ xi should not be used to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hi@@ bit the activity of five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic patients ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ Stat@@ e- Con@@ cent@@ ration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;

&quot; experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to follow @-@ up side effects ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions in the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events such as in other dosage groups were observed ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to be observed . &quot;
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were obtained with patients who were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ ameth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine , 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are sum@@ mar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; clinical trials of indication of chemotherapy induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were comparable to the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval and the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and prolon@@ ging the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study was to evaluate the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. of administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous injection follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration Time @-@ Cur@@ ve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations was 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations show that at once a daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 0,25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to the one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg higher , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; el@@ min@@ ation After intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
the total body clearance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min were performed .
&quot; although patients with severe liver dys@@ function have increased the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , reducing the dose is not justified . &quot;

&quot; 10 from prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and prolon@@ ging the action of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased inci@@ dence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ genous ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses of dos@@ ages and because Alo@@ is is intended for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low compared to humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the failure of the approval of the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drugs &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination shows the liver tissue damage , furthermore the values of the liver enzy@@ mes Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are ab@@ used in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that cover the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hep@@ atitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed that data for the stability of the drug and the drug could not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after setting up treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant to more patients than in reference medicines ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test used in the study to determine how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently validated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by hair infection ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties ( crack or cutting wounds ) , det@@ erg@@ ents and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which were demon@@ stra@@ bly or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was dischar@@ ged after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo agreed to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin burns , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results of both studies were taken at skin wounds , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough to treat ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the job .
&quot; the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Al@@ tar@@ go &apos;s benefits out@@ weigh the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ s , det@@ erg@@ ents or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients in which no improvement in two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , treatment should be broken , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ el@@ essly and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or is suspected or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- and other top@@ ical methods on the same skin surface is not investigated and simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved by people after top@@ ical application on a reduced skin or infected surface wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After the con@@ current dose of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int on a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral dosage and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; in deciding whether bre@@ ast@@ feeding is continued / completed or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , is to weigh between the benefits of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect irrit@@ ation was reported by the administration of about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; retinal det@@ achment is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ant eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ant eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that distingu@@ ishes itself from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; through binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding adjustment interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infection forms , should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of spon@@ ges with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sample removal was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ tations and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systematic intake of the human after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabolism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 with minor involvement of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in trials of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse ly@@ mph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , for oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport law must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as shown in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application form ( Version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the finished product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the approval for the transport sector is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities , as described in the 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Applied products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next peri@@ odic safety update report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms of the treated place , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expres@@ sly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes out of view on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ette tape unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ments , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ments . &quot;
ambient rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; ambient rix is used as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan , where a protection against hep@@ atitis B is possible only after the second dose is administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ ent may only be used if there is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the two doses of existing vacc@@ ines can be brought to the end . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher dose is desirable against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ ent or another hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
ambient rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult V@@ acc@@ ine since 1996 and the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children admitted since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within one of three doses of existing vacc@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; because ambient rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults are identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a receipt for the application of ambient rix . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibodies for a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
ambi@@ tions led between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the protection of ambient temperature was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month intervals between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common adverse effects of Ambi@@ ent ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernal ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) , not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals , a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ ent throughout the entire region . &quot;
&quot; there are two vacc@@ ines consisting of two vacc@@ ines , taking the first dose at the date of the choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refre@@ sher solution is required for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti@@ body values are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immune @-@ competent individuals who have responded to hep@@ atitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refre@@ sher as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ections vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standard procedure is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine that contains 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ ha@@ v@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ PLC anti@@ body is reached , so that in these cases the application of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ot@@ ence in the glut@@ eal muscle , these injection paths should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or bleeding distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ ent can however be sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously inj@@ ected , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ mus@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ent was administ@@ ered in the second year in form of separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us flight enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined meas@@ ure@@ - m@@ umps tube vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective disorders have to assume that there is no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this form@@ ulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernal , g@@ astro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever were comparable to the inci@@ dence associated with earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administ@@ ered to 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines in the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of ambient rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ernal on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ine dose ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ ent at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the test subjects had been administ@@ ered , with pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects , which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; however , the inci@@ dence of mat@@ ernal mort@@ ality was comparable to the overall vacc@@ ine in 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects that received ambi@@ tions compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of severe pain and mat@@ ernal mort@@ ality was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vacc@@ ine was observed with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study on 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ine , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that with the three @-@ cans combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not pro @-@ pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with ambient rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen were statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ rate rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ rate rates for anti @-@ ha@@ y were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two cans , Ambi@@ ent and 147 received the standard combined vacc@@ ine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hep@@ atitis B in month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after completion of the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with ambient rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine scheme with a combined vacc@@ ine with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ ha@@ v@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that , according to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ ha@@ v@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ine scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ ent was administ@@ ered at the same time with the refre@@ sher of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us flight enz@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ urable disease vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current form@@ ulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , such as for the earlier form@@ ulation . &quot;
the vacc@@ ine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to examine any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stu@@ ffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ent cannot be fully protected from infection with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is already infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus / is ( although you / your child feels uncomfortable or feels sick / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vacc@@ ine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
• If you / your child have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has an allergic reaction .
• If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prescribed dose prescribed by the second vacc@@ ine dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ine , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambient rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis A / Hepatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ine ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface treatment ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose , and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination before the end of the vacc@@ ine series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ ent is spra@@ yed with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ tions can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ w your doctor if you / your child takes more medicine ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated or vacc@@ ines ( antibodies ) have received / has received or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is insufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine needs to be given at the same time with ambient rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limb@@ s as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ent is to be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ ent pregnant or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women are not administ@@ ered , except it is urg@@ ently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ ent Please inform your doctor if your child has an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known since the issu@@ ing of the first approval for the transport sector , the CH@@ MP re@@ signed the view that the benefits risk ratio for Ambi@@ ent remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;

&quot; it was not a comparative study , because am@@ mon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia can also result in loss of appetite , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , imp@@ ot@@ ence , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ia was effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ia values .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine was given . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ folds form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life mat ) , an indication of the use when the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ active enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents with adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ f@@ ests lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to obtain Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not get to the stomach immediately . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium each 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ gestive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation associated with caution . &quot;
&quot; because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys is done , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous dose of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal decay and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ageing of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients entered at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ desirable events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ glut@@ amine is similar ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative bear@@ er for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that the So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is taken between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ f@@ ests of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ lic@@ ted , and the disease resulted in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post part@@ al ( however , within the first life months ) to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post part@@ al ( however , within the first life months ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities and other neuro@@ logical deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ time form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also examined in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were fifteen times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine to the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents with adolescents . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ f@@ ests lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium each 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ tes of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , there were les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain channel . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ glut@@ amine is similar ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative bear@@ er for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; on the basis of tests on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon is 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have laboratory examinations , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken drugs , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS because the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , follow @-@ up of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room for an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example , with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ gi@@ ox is used for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was in common with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS it was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other sh@@ ep@@ herds , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd author@@ isation for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift @-@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in emergency intervention or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if in another episode a PCI is performed , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , after clinical needs , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a maximum of 0.5 mg / kg will be administ@@ ered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a common bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second delivery of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the inci@@ dence of lower ACT values , the re@@ frac@@ tory and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis quickly administ@@ ered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administ@@ ered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ric u@@ din or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is 225 seconds , a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustments at an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular ha@@ par@@ in .
• serious kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur under Bi@@ val@@ en@@ u@@ din , most bleeding in arter@@ ial punc@@ tures can occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment generally occurs everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din has reached an existing level . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) , these substances can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in combination with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ological parameters are regularly monitored regularly . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ val@@ en@@ u@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe ble@@ edings were significantly less frequent in the group with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with di@@ amet@@ ers ≥ 5 cm at the point point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , using blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ valent bi@@ valent in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ en@@ u@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe ble@@ edings were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported to a comprehensive application in the practice and are group@@ ed according to system structures arranged in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately vom@@ iting and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or treated as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or is unable to process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very little from the insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ ta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous via continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the ab@@ domin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and the reduced insulin supply , insulin demand can be reduced in patients with a restri@@ ction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effect , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of manufacturing can pull up a change in insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or the breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ containing diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the insulin &apos;s active profile and can therefore change the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ tox@@ in , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ate , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tic such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserv@@ pin may be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on re@@ productive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin enters human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated according to oral use . &quot;

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area as a result a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of glucose through a physician . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ k@@ emic inj@@ ections , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine @-@ matter for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose levels ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver . &quot;
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin deficiency , the effect occurs faster and the duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , insulin delivery in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg has a proportional glu@@ cos@@ ate effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ ate effect , just like insulin . &quot;
