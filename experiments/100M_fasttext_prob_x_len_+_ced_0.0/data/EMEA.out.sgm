<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Department (EPAR) in which the trials conducted for human medicine (CHMP) have assessed the studies carried out in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you wish for further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injections solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic condition, in which the patients have a normal mood alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injections solution will be used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances if oral dosage is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used to take or use the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who simultaneously take other medicines, same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to interact with each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lower degree than the neurotransmitter, to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"because dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or physical symptoms and prevent their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injections solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered an increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients, with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered an increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body resorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significant increase in symptoms of increased restlessness than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled twitching), acathema (continuous movement), tremors, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly male episodes and their manic episodes linked to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day in a daily dosage of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including accentuated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when treated with abilify treat signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with varicose seizures in the anamnesis or in cases associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosing and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipene, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"because of the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is recommended when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in the CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting up the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should get advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data storage for people and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including strength vehicles to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients with Aripiprazole were treated with a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parinsonism, acathema, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>

<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the effects associated with antipsychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed only in adult patients with esteemed doses of up to 1260 mg, and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"there is no information about the efficacy of a haematalysis in treating an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose is beneficial because Aripiprazole has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significant reduction in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% was under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of approx.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a solidity effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, like lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic interventions, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar recovery, predominantly in the prevention of a return to the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyliation by Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyylation is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elmination focal length is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>

<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the influence of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity during repeated exposure, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canvasive potential, the preclinical data left no special dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse-toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchycin loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 3 to 10 times the middle Steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC).</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Department (EPAR) in which the trials conducted for human medicine (CHMP) have assessed the studies carried out in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where Metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients), which can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulphonetic acid or insulin, the current dose of sulphonetic acid or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilised and the blood sugar level sinks, allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better."</seg>
<seg id="754">"for more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was examined in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonine resin, in addition, they received either acetone or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="756">"actos led to lowering the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylresin in a reduction of HbA1c levels was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo was reduced to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients was examined, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin, decreased HbA1c levels of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoderthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">"in October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transport of Actos throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="763">"the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" 15 "and on the other side the wording" actos. ""</seg>
<seg id="764">"Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin, and in which metformin is unsuitable because of contraindications or incompatibilities (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="765">"for the application of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually."</seg>
<seg id="767">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve."</seg>
<seg id="768">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">"in this study, an increase in the reports of heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study."</seg>
<seg id="771">"in patients with increased output of liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used."</seg>
<seg id="772">"when the ALT mirrors are lifted up to 3-fold the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control again."</seg>
<seg id="773">"if a patient develops symptoms related to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper abdomen, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark harn, the liver enzymes are checked."</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be conducted before the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fat deposits and in some cases connected with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">"as a consequence of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred."</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">"as a result of increased insulin sensitivity, in patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonylresin or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="779">"in the treatment with thiazolidindian, including pioglitazon, the incidence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema was reported with a decrease in visual acuity."</seg>
<seg id="780">"it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema, if patients complain about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="781">"in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon"</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">"in the Proactive study, a study of more than 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="784">"patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or entering it, the treatment should be removed (see Section 4.6)."</seg>
<seg id="785">"studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of dioxoxins, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="786">"interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reducers are not to be expected."</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in treatment with pioglitazon the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal are reduced and thus reduce the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">"very often &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (of the present data)."</seg>
<seg id="791">"these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic properties."</seg>
<seg id="792">"in clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Annests were compared to the threefold of the upper limit of the normal range compared to placebo, but less rare than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylresin."</seg>
<seg id="793">"in an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure in Pioglitazon was 1,6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazon resins."</seg>
<seg id="794">"since the launch has been widely reported about heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="795">"a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials have been carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the group treated with pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the group treated with comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="796">"over a period of 3.5 years of Proactive study, fractures appeared at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day had no symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="798">"Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucosamine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after the treatment of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months).</seg>
<seg id="801">"after two years after the treatment, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by pioglitazon in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid)."</seg>
<seg id="802">"in a placebo controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite the three-month phase of insulin, were randomized to pioglitazon or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="803">"in patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazon was observed."</seg>
<seg id="804">"in clinical trials for a year, in Pioglitazon a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotives showed a statistically significant decrease in output values."</seg>
<seg id="805">"the effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetes."</seg>
<seg id="806">"in most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels were observed."</seg>
<seg id="807">"in clinical trials for a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid reduced overall plasmatrile glycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level."</seg>
<seg id="808">"compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was found, while Metformin and Gliclazid were observed."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both on the triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the Proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either pioglitazon or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, with the highest concentrations of unmodified pioglitazon in the plasma usually 2 hours after application."</seg>
<seg id="812">"on this basis, the contribution of M-IV contributes to the effectiveness of the three-fold of the effectiveness of pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="813">"in interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of dioxoxins, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">"after oral use of radioactive marketed Pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the harn (45%)."</seg>
<seg id="816">"the mean plasma elmination focal length of unmodified pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and all active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours."</seg>
<seg id="817">"plasma concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar."</seg>
<seg id="818">"in toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with haemelution, anaemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophy."</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in treatment with pioglitazon the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal reduces and thus reduce the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>

<seg id="1896">"a flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges, which can easily spread from human to human because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection)."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after administering the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as" "body-alien" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>

<seg id="1935">"based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase Capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function was reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be carried out with caution when patients with severe liver dysfunction are contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements containing the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerator or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenera does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>

<seg id="2971">The main indicator for effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta or subcutaneous via continuous infusion in the area of the abdominals."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and the reduced insulin supply, insulin demand can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effect, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zink delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of manufacturing can pull up a change in insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or the breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-containing diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the insulin's active profile and can therefore change the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopytoxin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphate, salizylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the effects of sympatholytic such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reservpin may be weakened or absent."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- lingluliine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-lulisin enters human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk, nor is it resorated according to oral use."</seg>
