&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Extensions . open the map tool@@ bar and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard set modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete . &quot;
&quot; the module is called a filter filter ( also called folder filters ) , in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under the Extras tab . with the module you can filter and kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current job directory in different ways . &quot;
&quot; to use DOM tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM element of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map view is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view of color mode , can be either Dep@@ th for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the figure of another file properties like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( whereby therefore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of display algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; the best methods in this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry , a room pattern is placed in the area of the higher order . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Widgets designed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ tom@@ cat .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . of course each medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the conversion conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .

&quot; if you want &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ nam@@ ents have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and then click on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your digital camera will set up . afterwards you should learn how to use My albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw @-@ camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . of course each medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together .
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . &quot;
&quot; g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , exp@@ and@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 is also supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos generally are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of pictures with g@@ photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , to read the preview pictures of digi@@ K@@ am reliably . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function , as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam could be done . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drawing and removing images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree tree , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . &quot;
&quot; if you are already our customer , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . : &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields used in the symbol view . this way , filtering on the file name only works if this ind icon view is shown . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog box icon . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ak ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; if you have a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;

&quot; the buttons El@@ der , average , new ester : these put the date on the date of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album will be as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ e ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ Ex@@ preview install@@ en@@ quot ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections can not be cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you must wait for short while the preview pictures are generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each picture is displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is this , you can change settings digi@@ kam ; set up . choose the albums page and adjust the preview pictures to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the preview pictures feature help window displays . if you leave the mouse po@@ inter a moment over a picture , the help displays the most important features including all of the photos . the screen shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
&quot; photos are all what it came to &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords will allow you to organize your images as it suits you . you can access all the functions that have been with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can access all the functions that have been with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose between the viewing of images , a slide or editing the images . &quot;

&quot; if you want to delete a photo and digi@@ kam it , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or de@@ f if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; de@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My dates limit ; organis@@ es your photos by the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos displayed with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also organise parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ft@@ ment , so you can easily find the keywords you &apos;re looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , and you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by either clicking on the right mouse button ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select New Key@@ word . if you click a new keyword once you click on an existing keyword , it will become the under@@ statement of this keyword . &quot;

&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then , a menu gives you the possibility to push the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and select the keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the &quot; &quot; album preview &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have searched the photos you want to have with a keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords from it . this way you can select a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made etc . &quot;

&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photos with the right mouse button and select from the Keywords @-@ menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per unit . a selection frame can be moved beyond this hist@@ ogra@@ m . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here the filter will be deleted and all images are displayed . if the search found nothing , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you will be able to save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . &quot;
&quot; if you select an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . if you select an advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added to the search group , one ... , one ... , one ... , one ... , one ... , one ... , No ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; the smaller the difference between two images , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . using a sw@@ ell@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from anywhere above the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand paint sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ kam ; find the right images .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder . &quot;
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L to add to the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select from a picture series . if you navigate p@@ airing pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the fields to compare . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ der reactions work directly from the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview pictures in the light table , for example , simply to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the image , you have to click it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the Zoom control under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zo@@ oming into the picture , and zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you preview in the mode preview . &quot;
&quot; what is a digital stock management ? digital inventory management considers each part of the process follows after the image has been taken , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can secure your images , find , protect and use photos . we focus on downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group@@ ing , backup , evaluate , estimate , estimate , estimate , search and export image files . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is defined according to your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data used by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to find a specific photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you &apos;ll probably not use &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be somehow on your computer . you must decide whether you want to store them on a reserved disk or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year on the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can store the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album &apos;s menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? &quot;
&quot; this makes sense , because you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s see keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it becomes &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the pictures to the correct place . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is covered . this is a very crude representation , since each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to miss your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ front ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others seeing your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it is the strength only to work with let@@ tering for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ?
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels via pictures with ge@@ ographic data . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and calls the practice to use copyright laws to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support commas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for summary row ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is a photographer for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate faul@@ ts , disk failure , power plugs , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these should be treated prud@@ ently and you may not be trusted longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives quality which keep longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control sums . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes mira@@ cles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged dis@@ ks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . of course , everything about CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read this media .
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warranty encomp@@ asses a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard dis@@ ks : disk Error &quot;
&quot; the most common cause of error , SM@@ ART is the most common error reason , SM@@ ART is the most common error reason , SM@@ ART can not detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices fail not much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes can cause serious damage . these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy balance and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . however , remember that not every plug bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . &quot;
some manufacturers provide a connection for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dem and the TV card .
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also include protection for the mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is also interesting . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before entering the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard dis@@ ks at home , however very expensive - 40 GB fees &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB fees &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; the professional version will be limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . your free memory is limited to 1 GB , and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very secure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission mistake occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these faul@@ ts remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo and this to your surprise . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses because they generate interc@@ encies within the data stream .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with plate defects at a low level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available at a G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by the z@@ fs , and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data in a plan and test this backup before you do anything more dangerous than installing your operating system , replacing boards or the size change of hard dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ plane space : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . &quot;
&quot; therefore , di@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files has been changed since the last full backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files has been changed since the last backup .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily setup on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ adata , stored in the image file , keep associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable images will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span you really are interested in to you because you remember your childhood or adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard . stay open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition .
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; # &#93; = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc , the new record is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( defl@@ ate ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG This digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ adata .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata platforms . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP adap@@ ts as it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I is part of the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve greater acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , card reader or scanner . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you process the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam ; then you should add the met@@ adata . these were cut under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into Web@@ Slider , code in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to get your photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; use it , connect it with the machine , turn off the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras exhibit no preview images . if this is the case , the file name and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need camera information for each entry . with the side bars and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file characteristics , and photo information stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available for all information . &quot;
&quot; this information is the same as with the met@@ adata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata is not available with some digital cameras .
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button , and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures are safely written into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then select selected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons All download or download selected , a dialogue with which you can select the target album will be displayed in which the photos are stored . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the requested photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all once by clicking the Delete delete all . if you want to delete a few , you must select it first and then delete selected del@@ e@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recre@@ ate photos you deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album , before you want to delete them from the camera . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can cause double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of various recording galleries into the same album . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transmission , three additional options will open before the photos are stored on the disk . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another date format as standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % Y % d % H : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option Camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; in the met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it leaves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , you can use it to automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally turned off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you must disable this option . &quot;
you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; see where the pictures are to be loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . &quot;
GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document .
&quot; not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural firms and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten about where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who wish to document the location of the photos , it is good to save the location data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data go into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has built a GPS unit . but there are a few who cooperate with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transfer@@ ring data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ d or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module . &quot;
&quot; there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the length and latitude grade or other data , you can use this script using the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool of Phil Harvey . it uses the characters ha@@ ft@@ ly coordinates , such as Map@@ s.@@ google.com . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in order to access these settings , you need to change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in order to access these settings , you have to choose settings in the settings digi@@ kam . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; when you select an entry in the main view , you can specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
IPTC : caption Parkway Drive live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for summary row : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this field should be desig@@ nations such as adverti@@ sed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
IPTC actions save the data in the respective IPTC field . it is achieved that met@@ adata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these met@@ adata also available other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
&quot; image labelling as embedded hardware ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with images embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse hand rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; digi@@ kam it came , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the Update button to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in the image editing mode it can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is a loss @-@ free algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF file , you can switch to the defl@@ ate -@@ compression algorithm for TIFF image . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it has no influence on the image quality since the defl@@ ate algorithm works loss@@ less . &quot;
&quot; you can always add product news , press releases , events and vacancies completely free of charge &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam it was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , you will solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , you will solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , you will solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance will be used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is based on a solid color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras .
&quot; the default is the sh@@ uff@@ le lights , so the parts of your images are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the pointed candles . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ construc@@ ting option , you will get the option to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour reconstruction .
&quot; as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) is the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces colour arti@@ facts to the edges . bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction procedure as you are done during the conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates colour information and gives instructions how to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the other , so that colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;

the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color mapping or gam@@ bit correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , as your printer has a smaller colour area than your camera and some colours can be very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is fores@@ een for what is fores@@ een for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style of the destination : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support those that have been written to work with each program that supports the ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the ki@@ pi modules , see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings . &quot;
&quot; for more information about ki@@ pi modules , please visit the ki@@ pi project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the ki@@ pi modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right side there exists a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here . &quot;
&quot; with option confir@@ ming dialog for moving images in the sleeve bu@@ ckets , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will have to update the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also prevent the display of the greeting screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; at the start . this speeds up the start @-@ up process of &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something from the base folder has been deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . the image processing can be started by clicking the left mouse button to preview an image , or by the context menu of preview and selection of the entry / edit entry . &quot;
&quot; the image editing features a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the ki@@ pi modules , see the image editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image editing will change your photos . however , the editing functions will change the original photo before you save the original photo , before you save the original photo , once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you might need to create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File &quot; &quot; Save &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery button or the button &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore &quot; &quot; button . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saved . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed , or re@@ produced . the last action can undo you by selecting the Edit reverse or re@@ produced by selecting editing from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ produce . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a moment longer via the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or use the entries in the file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu .
&quot; to custom@@ ize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can view this in the creation dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; click the main window . see the section for setting up the image processing window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the picture in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select print as@@ sistent from the menu album . if you follow the wizard , you will only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the same side bar is , without navigation arrows , also available in the image gallery . it will appear when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side bar appear and disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed .
IPTC data support only ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IPTC data base in other applications you should follow these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the button users or simply change to the next image , the lab@@ eling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write met@@ adata in the files . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation from the side bar is always only applied to a picture . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IPTC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the key word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords tree and a selection box with the keywords previously available in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session of the keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the entered search phrase . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of ways in searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when typ@@ ing keywords with a picture series . if you have entered a different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
passwords can also be set in the tree by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection . if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , keywords and search views are used . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop images . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any startup of the program . it can also be turned off under settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or more , you can easily change it with double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that already exists in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify a Advanced Search of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows : &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;

&quot; with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner , and that correspond to the colors that you print or publish in your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide sufficient background information about colour management . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your educational workflow meets all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
your only other picture editions are per e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is de @-@ facto standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB then works well and life for everyone so easy , why should you use another colour space and have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB colour in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ gely @-@ shaped region , and colours in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colors , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cali@@ br@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB is out of it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled down the lumin@@ ance values above the entire picture , so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the bri@@ ghtest dot as bright as possible without changing its colour shade . this function is often a mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; this method precisely adju@@ sts the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ film of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a picture .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you are able to perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities to correct correc@@ tions will be better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white balance algorithm , protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . &quot;
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side , both the original image as well as preview of the target picture can be seen . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; right up , a hist@@ ogra@@ m shows that dynamic changes are changed as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pipe . press this button and then click on the image preview to use selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the indicator indicator increases colors when more than one colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in white balance . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it into a text file and re@@ charge it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button puts all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you want to save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the coding depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is to be found in the menu under Col@@ umn correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels simultaneously , allowing you to adjust your settings so that you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound evaluation correction you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find gra@@ dation in the menu under colours . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a neon effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; the color , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this process ( 2 ) . the applied intensity lies at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect .
Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
&quot; the neon filter simul@@ ates neon light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the thickness of the neon light . in large images , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions , so it is not unusual to adjust the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of enhancing them . if you like the result , you can see the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . concrete the three sliders below the hist@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , active channel or the selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the kno@@ b and watch how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be seen . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , you can set the hist@@ ogra@@ m with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear history is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is useful . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls to be used to change the output values , i.e. , to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the for@@ eg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons you can save the set values stored in the file system and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shades , medium and solar panels . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogra@@ m &apos;s input values for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator monitors all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this drop box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short section to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of original photos , a red marking is visible . if you want to shift this mark on the field you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be stored in the file system , and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format . &quot;
&quot; if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the controls for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator displays all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel is over@@ exposed , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun @-@ tones were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel @-@ mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the image processing jQuery Slider window .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mono@@ chrome , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise that comes from the color space . &quot;
save as and load buttons will be used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator monitors all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .

green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter .
&quot; orange @-@ filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) orange @-@ filtered . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
&quot; yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes , similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) j@@ aun@@ filter . &quot;
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium sounds while it adds a bit of cold into the shades . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall . &quot;
&quot; relief : shift this parameter to the right , increases the appearance of the depth and three dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture . &quot;
a paper of texture has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified unter ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not a easy task .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired form of frame for your image . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of range is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool After page aspect ratio beforehand . &quot;
&quot; with this convenient tool , you can paste easily a form@@ atted text into a picture in any place . this also goes in multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text of text , orientation , color from colour space and character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; every setting you choose for your text can be changed until you click the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Template , you can put a template over a picture . &quot;
the image template you can use in the image processing can be used to lay st@@ encils on a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam , just send an e @-@ mail to the digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your favorite Fol@@ der Fol@@ der with the Fol@@ der base folder . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the s@@ lon@@ en@@ folder . selecting a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; in case you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to shift the image below the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ p@@ ness . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ p@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p , and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
the same phenomenon can be observed when color dots are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color dots are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color dots are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more after@@ ward shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; the JPEG format supports 8 bits per color ( red , green , and blue ) and produces relatively small file sizes . &quot;
&quot; if you disable this , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ p@@ ness of shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing one image increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus on . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . standard values often generate good results and should first be tried . an increase of radius or the amount increase the effect . &quot;
&quot; high resolution images allow larger radi@@ os . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage of the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . thus , the thickness of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fra@@ ction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference by using a soft change between the tones of shar@@ p@@ ness and thus avoiding blem@@ ishes in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred with radi@@ os = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ foc@@ usses an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected Ent@@ f@@ ission filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the sw@@ elling pixels , which are far from the original qu@@ il@@ pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most of the pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness is wrong . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons will be used for this purpose . any more re@@ focused parameter you have set , will be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp masks produce better results than shar@@ p@@ ness . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mask to use a larger neighborhood than shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masks must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see : &quot;
this image has been made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the lens focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ p@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ il , the smooth@@ ness of the range has been dark@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image missing correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by I@@ MAGE Team des Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to fine adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed accounting p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image . &quot;
&quot; comp@@ action dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film bas@@ tion or CCD ring@@ ing will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor across all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , put this value matching to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is used . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbo effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is running . normally this is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ step &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . &quot;
integ@@ r@@ ale steps &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integral steps in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing , never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only minimal , but it dou@@ bles the running time . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; as you see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact that has been made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in most cases , you will find a complete description of all parameters . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness level . if it is raised , noise peaks are eliminated . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ation occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge of edge for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the filter response . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image .
color : controls color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process of which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically more dist@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ it@@ ter@@ damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save up and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and then loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft@@ ly is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s rus@@ hing noise , film gra@@ ding , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors in digital , original or later digit@@ alized pictures . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was carried out by the I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project .
&quot; JPEG image file reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ ase ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can her@@ eby be saved in a text file and then re@@ loaded .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the kno@@ b . &quot;
the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts produced by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ aper . &quot;
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the dark picture . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the correc@@ ting image . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all view@@ points .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical lines . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 from pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; cub@@ ical : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cu@@ bic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; vi@@ gn@@ ette correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , to correct an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often not be ev@@ enly lit throughout the sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ g@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by allowing the light to reach the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise imp@@ airing effects can be created by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and colour and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter checks the degree of light strengthening at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re@@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu colour gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ der treats the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ der has a similar round effect , but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the fourth gra@@ der correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value checks the thickness of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value checks the thickness of the distortion of the fourth gra@@ dient . this value works more strongly in the margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corner parameter has the revers@@ ed character of the parameter . &quot;
&quot; zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size , resulting in a correction of the first grade . negative values increase while positive the image is reduced . &quot;
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview shows the distortion modification . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; in case you re @-@ cut a picture and perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect is apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal au@@ xiliary line . move it to an important place , like the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives like pictures from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective of correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . check the Sub@@ ge film bas@@ tion option if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gra@@ ining and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; the filter color channels used to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top light .
&quot; this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mono@@ chrome images , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can cali@@ br@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film bas@@ al effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity equ@@ als ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth brushes are better suited for large images . smooth controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the lines , which define the outline in drawing , are emphasized . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . &quot;
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity of intensity .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter Grav@@ ur shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was marked in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion @-@ effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the kno@@ b .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using non @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; zoom bl@@ ur@@ ry : bl@@ urred the image along stern@@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a focus . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera , producing a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ urred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glos@@ sy soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the colour pool in the picture and bl@@ ur it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows the size of drops to change . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size doesn &apos;t automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can drag the area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example , a face that should remain free to choose . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo blown is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blown up was developed by I@@ MAGE Team des Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ G project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the new size will maintain the aspect ratio of the original image when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is used . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbo effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and load will be used exactly . each inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as a text file and then re@@ loaded .
&quot; photo blown is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the kno@@ b . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows this very simple . to cut a photo , you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then you will see the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to cut out by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the average , use the button The Cutting @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; the tool After page aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically close the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;

harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden centre : the golden centre is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns , such as spiral of a Nau@@ ti@@ lus shell or the leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to construct your tem@@ ples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden centre provides more liquid au@@ xiliary lines if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ level gel the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ il@@ ateral tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of the professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divi@@ des .
&quot; if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and tool free rotation . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function transforming crop from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; an elegant way to cut the image , the function Automati@@ cally cut . select one of the following options : &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
corner left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a little dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double @-@ effect effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get irre@@ plac@@ eable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming crop from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is not a rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module on transforming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; you can sh@@ ave your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sh@@ ave horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . if you click on preference settings , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line will be embedded . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets a bit bl@@ urred . for a single s@@ ling this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two shots generate twice as much wis@@ er and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the shooting , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming crop from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam ; in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions , and you can change this list of file extensions . you can find more information in the configuration section . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour . you can read raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; with this , more than 200 raw data formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format .

many tools that you need for photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ p@@ ness , soft@@ ening , noise reduction , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ ry , etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture applicable ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image .
vertical divide without duplic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; the upper area shows the original and the lower , compared to the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters during shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color p@@ all@@ ets , and selecting colors . &quot;
&quot; in the latter case , you are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or search the folders to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area alongside a color .
&quot; the colour is described under the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area adjacent to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is checked in the cur@@ sor under the button color , the color panel will be added to the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on the mode over@@ writing has been selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection which has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ line character , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , it can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;

the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in the graph is in &amp; kate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in an &amp; kate ; component to open

other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pre@@ suppos@@ es the graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs .
&quot; the main window displays open graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only opens the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can set up your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings c@@ ach@@ viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; an instance is open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice of opening a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; or you want to open the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards . &quot;
&quot; when you program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice either as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split across multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
&quot; if you want to use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ ene that come on one side will be fitted to this page . the page aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph without header and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ al load page gives the possibility to determine the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
you can specify a standard behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time you are asked .
the seat management page gives the possibility to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens other possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries on the web page of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as a few edge over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces images according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in this process , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring @-@ model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ trigger trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered gra@@ phs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the knots circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagra@@ ms of multi @-@ cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then run by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ eme as parameters , and specify the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify specific options , or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( judged or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) , and turns the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for imp@@ aired graph@@ ene ) . &quot;

&quot; the ki@@ pi module for geographical loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image , and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF snap@@ shots of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo to loc@@ alize . height , length and latitude grade are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; in order to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . this file contains , of course , data that were taken at the same time at the same time as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time , and therefore the camera time must be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; for the maximum time devi@@ ation , there is a higher vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is included , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2,000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have track data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location . as the dialog turns the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and placed by the displayed map . select the region and enlarge it again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed manually . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the ki@@ pi module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to version 4@@ .01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; with the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side , you can choose to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your related images . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; the JPEG format supports 8 bits per color ( red , green , and blue ) and produces relatively small file sizes . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard colour depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occur during production . &quot;
the ki@@ pi screen viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view pictures .
&quot; the ki@@ pi screen viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or displac@@ ement . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ apped . it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the ki@@ pi JPEG Loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
click Start ! and your NEF photos will soon be boo@@ sted . format NEF Company Nikon
&quot; the result of loss @-@ free storage is the file size , because no compression of color information takes place . this can be found in the PNG format . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module Digital Camera Kli@@ ent currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the ki@@ pi teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the ki@@ pi module Met@@ adata Editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the ki@@ pi team .
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats supported . &quot;
the ki@@ pi MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
&quot; the MPEG converter can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshows . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slides . this module is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD formats for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the images that should be packed into MPEG slideshows . after that , you can start using ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate an image . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set up next . in doubt , you should set them black . in doubt , you should set them black . you can set the name and path of the file created in the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages via the button settings to the right . &quot;
&quot; the print assist allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper , along with standard phot@@ og@@ ames . these combined images can also automatically be opened with image processing Gim@@ p . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the color of pictures , as well as fix red @-@ eye and crop out unwanted parts of an image . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in .
&quot; the raw image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have an effect . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; when you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; the JPEG format supports 8 bits per color ( red , green , and blue ) and produces relatively small file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the JPEG format supports 8 bits per color ( red , green , and blue ) and produces relatively small file sizes . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting button the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ kli@@ ft processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . therefore , use this mode if you are secure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of multiple images in an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image , four types of image changes are provided : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
non @-@ Pro@@ por@@ tional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . &quot;
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images you have previously selected . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag images to the picture list , and add it to the list of the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; Delete images &quot; &quot; you will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected all the images , click OK the New Message window of your email client . you will only have to add the addresses and the subject . &quot;
most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and re @-@ used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the GM@@ ON agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the pictures will be added to the images in a text file and the mail is included . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best suited to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; the JPEG format supports 8 bits per color ( red , green , and blue ) and produces relatively small file sizes . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to display your slides . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; Open@@ GL uses very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise the slides will be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the option file name displays , that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation . &quot;
the loop option will ensure that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it manually .
&quot; the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not used the order of pictures in the album . &quot;
the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . by chance choose between the images another effect .
&quot; during Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left screen edge . move the mouse in this corner to switch it . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menus , as background for your K@@ DE desktop space . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can be with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now available in every group , so in people , places and in the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information than you have posted your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images will appear on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of pictures displayed by a few thousand pictures on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view preview images to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol before their name . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images beside the names , select the button , which is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , you have to select the image for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to open the image image window ( described in detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the main window in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; you can also enter a section of two data , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images that Jes@@ per , however , are not shown in Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the User &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tions videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or choose the menu entry photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . then some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name says , this bar displays you date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be shown in the preview window ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview image . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the time bar by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the flas@@ k and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically explained . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page , you can set up different resolutions for the pictures . this allows those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , resulting in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder is saved and automatically compl@@ emented with the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . you can , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can view on the Export File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; with the option Manu@@ ell to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; paste images with the Automati@@ cal option to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it &apos;s usually not worth to comp@@ ress files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , it becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import@@ ing is made up of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category person of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories will be imported to the import@@ ing file , and which categories will match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to search and view pictures : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups and m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures shown on this friend . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) specify the information about your images , about ( 2 ) viewing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has started as a program for managing your images . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ xml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings will be explained . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can access the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available for each setting , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories are already mentioned in the section . in dialogue options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group , instead of all groups of one medi@@ ator , as explained in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window , a list of the sub@@ categories can be selected . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page which you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared together , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are tested only very little . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have been warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via ki@@ pi are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use ki@@ pi , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this sort of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; the current album , which is simply the current view , is all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , you have to submit a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser can show the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to use the category for example , you will be able to do so , so if you have chosen people to view it and give the module it on . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see an example of a starting screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , see the menu and tool@@ bar above the top of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to add any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons seen on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can set certain notes either individually or for a larger number of images . if , for example , shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen were recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you can always use them again if you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the displac@@ ement of the pictures within the list : if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can see that the names used are moved up to the top that people find and arrange them faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture , you might want to process all selected pictures and provide them with comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons below the preview of the image to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item more than once with a re@@ mark . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in order to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the note dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the text dialog by clicking and move the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window open from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... , among other things , to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the Options ... and then window a / hide window . see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry of images in the browser , you will get an overview of preview pictures of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete , and press the Edit button or select the Edit menu . now , you will see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the images anywhere , so that you can record the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &quot;
&quot; in the menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . &quot;
&quot; in this way , you have set the images to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to block the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry , which allows all images you want to be locked . if you want to see the images again , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the Privacy Policy . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very secure . for one , you can read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . &quot;
the reason why you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
&quot; the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have entered the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can easily move it with the mouse and place somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the picture high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide show . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to move in full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can tap into the image and zo@@ oming . you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that work in and out with the plus and minus keys .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen , you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to have on the picture . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad , while you watch one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have added features to your images , you are in your browser . this can be seen in the browser . &quot;
&quot; this can be done from your control panel . if your company is not yet listed , you need to make a listing first . &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the old will not be saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to end the painting from the context menu . in order to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ items are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are any possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be inserted so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar below , or from the right mouse context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have incorrect values , click on users to make these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then you can correct the input error and then click on users or disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you process a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; if you want to render only one part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , select locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a fe@@ asi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects will only appear if they are selected , or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the object tree and the view of object properties are shown on the right , and the four graphical views are shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another order , you can adjust it as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different directions . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the beginning to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
you can then switch between views by clicking on the map ladder to the top of the views .
&quot; the last possible window codes are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the working area or click on the small pointing arrow pointing upwards . &quot;
&quot; to close a view click on the small cross in the bar bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any position . &quot;
the latest window view can save you with view window code ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window name under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ame it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View Strange . &quot;
&quot; a render mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a fast preview to full @-@ scale images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the symbol The render settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image detail to ren@@ ders into the input fields . &quot;
in combination @-@ field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user retro @-@ diff@@ user lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray of pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is a adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively , because the super sampling the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; re@@ winding , because each pixel is divided over repeatedly and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray will track a beam each pixel . if the difference between the colour values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then both pixel will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between colour values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually tra@@ cked and checked by further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you switch j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Con@@ sole Edition . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command line of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ enab@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert sources for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , too . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that don &apos;t lie in the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second colour is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second colour is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type hall@@ marks .
&quot; you can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model view . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the level of detail for two directions . &quot;
&quot; extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exemp@@ tions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; when you display wall display , a wall is rowed behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a bottom is reduced below the objects . the bottom is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section , you will explain how to create and save window orders . &quot;
the Combin@@ ation Standard Window Proc@@ edure : displays all existing window instructions . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window codes when starting the program .
&quot; the list of window instructions shows all existing window instructions . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement , and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove . &quot;
every window name is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
&quot; the list below the name displays all views for the chosen window order . new views can be created by clicking the button , and delete selected views with the Remove button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with the New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just started &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain that you can only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have any error @-@ free installed , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following set of windows : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this tutorial , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you produce . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button or press En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might include a box ( inser@@ ting End@@ ial Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user or press button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; if you render the scene , the plane stretched to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; select the floor to set out its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pig@@ ment will then change in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments is only a matt black material , because you have to enter the pig@@ ment settings at any time . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the fa@@ der and ball in the preview , click on the user and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now correctly set . if you ren@@ ders your picture with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called single colors . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the check@@ er@@ board colour list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose colour @-@ colored each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to run this step , as you should already have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to push the button or button to press ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the ground around one unit to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is a strange result : as before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can as@@ sign a material now . as already in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ strate and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment sphere , then select Color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take time to set some finish features : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots , and click on users or press En@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
ra@@ y@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ting a scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously every scene needs to be reduced , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it &apos;s a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;

a b@@ ump map is a way to model smo@@ other surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these foundations . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; a texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on pixels , using an image file as a color map . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple .
&quot; you can set whether every picture should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right corner . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue set @-@ up - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the keys can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display is filled with the background colour you can move further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when loading the name of the last opened folder . next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also be displayed . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be magni@@ fied on the full screen . this option is enabled as default . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the slider tool or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;

&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that have the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo ; change . in order to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings show@@ photo menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color shown when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page , in which you can click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SAN@@ E project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; quot lite ; with the c@@ ann@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; on the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner has been specified , a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; quot lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not treated especially .
&quot; to get a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the pre @-@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the picture , the user can select the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving , then the image will be saved , then the image will be saved , and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the settings dialog , the name of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sv@@ lite ; save images . dialog to Save for each image opens the dialog box in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sv@@ lite ; this will automatically save you with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select Save without asking a file name . &quot;
&quot; the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog box . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;

Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; and Amar@@ ok also has some command line options .
&quot; you should give an answer to the user if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dencies . please check in your script if all required modules are available , and make sure that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; and am@@ aro@@ k ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . this is why scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use of it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , Amar@@ ok relies on the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece will be played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions you might ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length of the piece ) .
volume change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; stop , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; this package is basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is finished , you can load it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the wiki script page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . you might just look for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok is an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following folder in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options you can activate or disable the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without difficulty with setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed . &quot;

&quot; you need to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; require some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files brings a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can locate the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . &quot;
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib is used when reading the meta data from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat exhausted . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler release . if , for example , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , turn off auto mode when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail opens automatically when you crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the meta @-@ info , but they do not mark as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;

&quot; after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , only an empty play@@ list appears . &quot;
&quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window was converted to the statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
you can also use the short@@ comm@@ ons Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .

&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card using hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or via the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to indicate another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
g@@ stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer reads the file and en@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . g@@ stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;

&quot; you probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; * I downloaded your free version to see if I could get it to work with my website , and I am almost there ( I have been looking for something like this for ages ) .. &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IRC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( exit am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : D@@ CO@@ P am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start play@@ back . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the soft tones of music you have stopped before you go to bed . &quot;
how to find the currently in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; current title when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size @-@ changeable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e queu@@ e . by pressing the input button after a search in the play@@ list , the first search will be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tricky functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive .
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; for automatic code , you can use files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , list FROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE url = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( url ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous rating with a decreasing value based on how often the play was played . the more the play was played , the less influence has every single review on the overall result . &quot;
you can change the evaluation of a piece by yourself by clicking on a column heading to a column heading in the play@@ list window .
developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you want to release a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that doesn &apos;t work with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of am@@ aro@@ k .

old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports are caused .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile these output modules . you must &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re @-@ comp@@ ile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use am@@ aro@@ K to use the second sound card ?
&quot; setting settings am@@ aro@@ k ... audio output insert the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with one on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , type us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick in sound card support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is no longer looked after . you may naturally like this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed assistant for the Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be shown at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to update your collection or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . &quot;

&quot; the rest of the player player consists of play@@ back buttons , volume control and piece position slider . use the slider to set the piece position or volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audi@@ ot@@ ters . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to show the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the EQ in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer button , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
the play@@ list of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player .
&quot; the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the play@@ list , such as the context @-@ browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information about the current unit . its look can be customized using context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ categories : music , text and interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you might notice that the sub@@ windows start off . the information presented there are now available in other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the information displayed in the statistics window can be viewed ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ windows music displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title it is the name of the piece , artist and the album . &quot;
under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; in order to display cover images in the context @-@ browser , the cover images must be supported in the same folder as the current piece . the pictures may contain any names , but images with the word front in the name are treated . the context @-@ browser will also display images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces there are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information in the music sub@@ window should be displayed . click the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , Albums of the interpre@@ ter , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you see the content of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in each field to start play@@ back . you can also click on the right mouse button , and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , you try to download the text for the piece from the web . if not running a text script , you can choose which is to be started . &quot;
the Edit allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is needed .
the button Search opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;

&quot; when the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are sorted out by genre , including interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Artists / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can custom@@ ize and combine the group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view , as well as in the building supervision . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter , there is a selection panel with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose your entire collection , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking right @-@ click on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;

the lower part of the play@@ list browser does the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the intelligent play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created intelligence play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart play@@ list . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used to connect &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you can find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ te in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list of interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area where you can search for a file . search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden files that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is a address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL . if you are using music from a given URL and press En@@ ter , you can access music in the music file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachments of files by simply drop down can be difficult . in the case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ list contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter the letter , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter into spaces separated search terms , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , close the search term with ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller searches . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , ask a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you wish . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ alternate : bad . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then clicking on the right mouse button in the desired order click the entries . the entries will then receive a certificate with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be returned . &quot;
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list .
&quot; next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the retri@@ eval rate can be set to the analy@@ zer with one click of the right mouse button . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you will see in the player window on the right mouse button .
&quot; there are many other available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example play@@ lists and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars there . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about play@@ list . it shows the title of the current unit , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also remove the status bar , and disable the status bar option in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list to menu . via this menu , you can reach the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k settings . &quot;
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plugin . there you can select the Visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your big move in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece in the play@@ list , then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the play@@ list , or use the context menu in the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details of the setup of these follow later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection , and add other random items during play@@ back . &quot;
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm Refer@@ ences ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ fm profile so that this dynamic play@@ list works .
&quot; in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om Mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill your play@@ list and you can add the play@@ list right away . the play@@ list has to be added at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current play@@ list , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will be your existing play@@ list as starting point . &quot;
&quot; button New , fill up the current play@@ list and add new pieces accordingly to the dynamic mode . edit play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the play@@ list settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be heard twice in this play@@ list . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to play@@ list after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the play@@ list will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you select multiple play@@ lists , you will add random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by starting the script and then click setup .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; install scripts by clicking on the script . you can open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alization plugins will be used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an easy installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that you will get a worse quality when re@@ coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check whether an audio CD has been created by a loss@@ less format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data @-@ CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you have to have a run @-@ up installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data @-@ CD , please choose ex@@ tras , copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialogue with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the button Start . you can now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copying process . once the original file is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium that the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a fully open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio en@@ coding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 de@@ coder which can compete with commercial en@@ co@@ ders in terms of quality and speed . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ coder Module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C de@@ coder module and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured author system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage , e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed with which you can select folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has been changed and not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen , you can then choose between saving and modifications . you can then cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will be asked for any un@@ saved project , which is to happen , just as if you have called for each project file Sch@@ eme . &quot;
closes all open projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it will be asked what should be done so as if you have called a file .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the added files appear in the CD &apos;s base folder . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only open if the project contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it promp@@ ts &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , import imported files from the current project . &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs , you should also choose to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can burn later . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can burn later . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , allowing the content to be deleted completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you must use other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned out by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the full video , en@@ coding settings , and even options for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media @-@ Info , locks , and unlock the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the keys assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs , so you must enter the password for the administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ on@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and align the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function range , so it is more your taste and the type of your task is critical to which the assist programs you prefer . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the D@@ CO@@ P command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project on the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
&quot; K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String representing ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; in this way , it is possible to fill a data @-@ project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data @-@ project , several folders and then add files to the new folders : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) D@@ CO@@ P $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&quot; currently , l@@ ame supports MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you need to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; which code / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while set @-@ up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD will be explained . this will result ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble on at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the step , for example , you can find further information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case it must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the setup directory settings in the setup directory - en@@ coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , allowing an already exhausted file to en@@ code it instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , picks ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different map cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ con@@ uts and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; Sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both Ko@@ di@@ erer produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower bit@@ rates compared to O@@ GG . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ test@@ ers is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo installations . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people , and most of the music &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo installations with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo installations with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approx . 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo installations with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate around 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car stereo equipment . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo installations . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file name , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters . the manual or the help to the en@@ coder explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &quot; ... &quot; tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can download / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download / enter the information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Title , Artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( with the translator : that &apos;s the author ) is not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than those used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This can only know the progra@@ mmer who has reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , ge@@ ographi@@ cally on the next mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less comp@@ ressing for audio data ) are displayed on the tab card to set the en@@ coding . other codes can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer is used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined Ko@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing an en@@ coder , you can obtain more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , read and read and see whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step , for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , since it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you own write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section treats the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably done only once and
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each CD . &quot;
&quot; here , we determine the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is transferred to the read@@ out program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this doesn &apos;t work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional transformation can be defined . &quot;
&quot; only for incomplete information requests , so that you will be informed if information is missing for generating keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the map card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; . this is subject to a low risk if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame , and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter anything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be received ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we do not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load between the hosts will be distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as regards the server , as many fire@@ walls make the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time issu@@ ing pieces : excuse , there is one reason why more than one simultaneously with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; a user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if only place on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances , something must be left to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo installations . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) , and output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files simultaneously : in a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a link to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each issu@@ ing &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; because we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different than the data collected for a &amp; CD . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter the data manually instead of picking them out of the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then search in the Questions and Ans@@ wers section , or go back to the previous section on the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry , which is best for your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have the connection box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first unit
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input fields &apos; curr@@ en title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; curr@@ en title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data like in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words are beginning with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the comment field . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the files generated later at any time by day editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ produce ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
Tags are not supported by all en@@ coding or file formats .
&quot; for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second item . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title details of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . simply click on the line to select the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the Select All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; click OK , then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on tab &quot; &quot; Cont@@ acts &quot; &quot; to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently displayed on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message can be seen if you &apos;re trying to work with a sh@@ aver , which you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you check if you have read write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is in the queu@@ e of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message is embedded in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , if it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs has many variations in settings . the best way to read the step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used for example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading this ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any indication as it should go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot keep this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ de ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iegel of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ time emphasis on texts also some features , the other &amp; UN@@ IX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ players do not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system and should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you are in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window can be on k@@ mid .
&quot; supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events , or text events ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , you will start again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu item or press the space key . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically once you click on the &amp; k@@ mid . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played on each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ w and adjust the play@@ back speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
controls : this game is played with mouse only .
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed , and even better : the event type will be automatically calculated using a song so you don &apos;t have to adjust it manually . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries of text events and song events from the Settings menu . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section , how you can efficiently use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the Coll@@ ecting Manager . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the selected items in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs that you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the Coll@@ ecting Manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece will be added to the active collection using file opening or drag &amp; drop . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on distance . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above kar@@ ao@@ ke lyrics . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select Next Song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; in order to jump back a song back , select the Previous item , the record previous item from the menu or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the Coll@@ ecting Manager , select the collection manager , select the collection and click the Delete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always makes a trumpet sound when playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
MIDI @-@ Map is a text file which stores all the required conditions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section must appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
&quot; * * * Sorry , this property owner doesn &apos;t provide a description in english ... pre@@ zzo consi@@ gli@@ ato * In case you don &apos;t have access to extended information such as sound samples despite logging on as a member , make sure your security level is not too high . &quot;
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to show that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as E @-@ Mail to enable me in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with number M . if your keyboard does not support a rifle ( for example with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds like a rifle . &quot;
&quot; if you want to play a note with patch 127 ( rifle shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that this is meant with the term &quot; &quot; Tro@@ mmel patch &quot; &quot; in which each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . check out the key@@ maps supplied .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . if you want to change the first and the second channel , make it easy in the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following sample : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value of pitch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio will be multip@@ lied in which pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . thus , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value of 40@@ 96 is used so that the map file is not dec@@ im@@ al . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch B@@ ender event with the value of 40@@ 96 , is to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will try to play two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a little with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see what sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu below the channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good Synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , enable the setting of automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down play@@ back . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have to play on a &amp; k@@ de ; work area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or if I want to play a file ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only quickly without adding them to a collection , turn on automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ .@@ You only want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ .@@ Your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do it ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage you to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I am trying to take a bit of time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you want to send me a postcard or an MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ( if you want it ) . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and never gets money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I can only continue to program because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at A@@ WE cards was too high .

&quot; and of course , my thanks to all these outstanding musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files . &quot;
&quot; you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external Synthes@@ izer because sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ WE card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to comp@@ ile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; send user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links below the menu Book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category for permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and play@@ back starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose the same with play@@ list from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost when you leave the edit mode , or select another group without the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation of starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted simply . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will follow the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation of the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end animation , but the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the view of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ted ; &amp; lt ; img dur = &quot; &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / mum@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / mum@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / &quot;
&quot; there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here , the path can be set up from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the disk from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this play@@ back in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; flash &quot; &quot; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even add the special field video to YouTube in play@@ list XML . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player is to be used in a con@@ soles application , and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . the st@@ acked process is kn@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors here , the Back@@ end issue inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player is to check the back@@ end output inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; before TV can be st@@ owed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be identified by which one is selected . the coding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player only uses X@@ video , X@@ video should also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension for the X server must be functional . &quot;
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . &quot;
is there any hint how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely safe to make / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts slowly but why do I need to check my CPU for their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only for the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . using Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be used for the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , contact the k@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
&quot; questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ; on or will be desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate , and to find out his options , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , you can also use a La@@ ie ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; but a less demanding but more realistic recognition is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the \ \ begin { document } command , and must be closed again with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : her@@ eby the character en@@ coding is set . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the cross section . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Buch ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source text editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
this function can be used in the menu settings ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and Sub@@ scription the lowest element ) :
&quot; if you think this is a server error , please contact the webmaster . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful for return search . as soon as a DVI file is created , it jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information as the font , and is in addition to PDF the default output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and to print out DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , it will jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other embedded .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file is installed to enlarge â ¬ propor@@ tion@@ â ¬ propor@@ tionally and there is no call of &amp; ok@@ ular ; after the quick build . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be opened . the selection fields were developed for quick inser@@ tion of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... Die ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box for further information is to insert articles such as keywords , joints or references . the possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; description : with this command , a name is created for a section , a picture or different element . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
the author has a good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
&quot; the final selection box with the name of the font size is used for determining the font size . it can be set font sizes for the main text , the fox node etc . there are the following font sizes available : &quot;
&quot; when you call &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font size doesn &apos;t set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; environment ( environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few swe@@ ets should have a different font size . &quot;
there is no limit ( number ) for correc@@ tions within an environment .
&quot; these commands end either by command \ \ end , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is intended for the recur@@ sive pressure and is as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed in a phrase using \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex , then a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile follows . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ k output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document using file ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI file to other formats . as soon as the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into selected other formats can begin using the button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ok@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; open and jump to the corresponding line . this must be &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ok@@ ular ; in &amp; ok@@ ular ; set as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if a bug is available , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty document , a document can either be re@@ written or used by the assistant to create a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; temporary users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same initi@@ alization for almost all documents . templates can be in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file is opened or a new file can be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings General be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is used by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created , the following steps must be completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created in a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; works ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called the La@@ TeX reference . it contains an outstanding description of nearly all commands that are in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use the syntax as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way you can select \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with ge@@ dr@@ yed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can select parts of the source code in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse various types of source texts and to emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands differ from the normal text and the mathematical form@@ ulas are emphasized by another colour . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; kate , which offers excellent opportunities , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which contain an empty line on both sides ) . &quot;
select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an advanced meaning as this command also allows &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return block ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; at the end of a section of the document , it can be well @-@ balanced and removed by pressing the de@@ f button . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit items paragraph .
&quot; it has already been shown that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under the Edit Area for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , the current environment is spra@@ yed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to expand the environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; at the input of many hidden environment commands can quickly be lost . this command elimin@@ ates the most recently planted environment , so that the anne@@ xed environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex group , group # is , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many scre@@ wed @-@ welded groups braces can quickly be lost . this command elimin@@ ates the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex group is not broken . &quot;

&quot; if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not just a line break , but at the same time the \ \ item command . &quot;

even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables @-@ environments , and in doing all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set up special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are three different modes of operation . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings K@@ ile ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed , and it may increase the complete loss list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; allow you to make settings for these lists . you can select different fon@@ ts for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ bÃ ¼ cher of the general language used .
&quot; the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the operation mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environment is used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when you entered the completion mode , the menu opens automatically and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment prevents the environment in simpl@@ est way and will be termin@@ ated by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; after this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognise that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is being implemented . &quot;
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; allow settings to be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of damage mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&quot; the list can be set up under Settings K@@ ile . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word processing mode will be replaced by the Men@@ Ã ¼ tt@@ ger Str@@ g + Alt Space button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter can be written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of all already written W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... Continue reading K@@ ile Ver@@ sions . here , the threshold value can also be set for the display of completion . &quot;

&quot; often work on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members , and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select from the list of the team members who he is . this is done by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( its identi@@ fier ) is bold after which you are : text .
&quot; nickname : ( is displayed on the page , if no entry appears &quot; &quot; an@@ onym &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something is done in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone has worked on , or a script that plays a file to the CV@@ S once it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; events can be created , edited and deleted on the site configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email is sent to the addresses selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see in , there will be such conductors . &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note is simple . it can either be selected from the editor &apos;s contex@@ tual menu or the @ ann@@ otation key word in a comment field followed by note text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with the nickname of the nickname of the team member , is to play a role in the project . &quot;
&quot; nickname : ( is displayed on the page , if no entry appears &quot; &quot; an@@ onym &quot; &quot; ) &quot;

the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car complet@@ eness can be changed . entries are :
&quot; in case you don &apos;t have access to extended information such as sound samples despite logging on as a member , make sure your security level is not too high . &quot;
&quot; large / lower attribute of attributes : large / lower case of automatically added attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : when checked , it will be added to tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
&quot; standard character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created , or in other ways than with file open @-@ opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is displayed from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regularly creates backup copies , so that during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in an own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source text at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the default back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changes of the M@@ DI Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cken / dependent on page@@ views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
warning messages -@@ area is used to control the display of warnings by att@@ aching not anymore .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in divided mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser No@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means , there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ code ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin when it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is delivered to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts typically refuse the loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct . select the saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . &quot;
currently only a plug @-@ in is available ; the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserted .
&quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . using the options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection panel , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view where all mounting points , with index numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will trigger the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ gers . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or closes the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; when this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug@@ ging requirement is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; when this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens while a script is given , the execution will start as soon as a requirement is set . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger execute the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include . &quot;
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of new posts by email .
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the measured value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered , or a new value of a variable is set . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which can be found at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you become better .
&quot; document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for markers and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic lists of image buttons ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details about converting . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow fast inser@@ ting tags into a document without risk of a writing error . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than one element type above itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a non @-@ element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it lays the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a one element element element . &quot;
&quot; are the source code used for filling the attributes in the Tag Editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that coll@@ ects the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tag . this element is a non @-@ element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a non @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces are not affecting anything , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace this will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tool Dialog Up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is to launch and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ e.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; Skip function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for re@@ achable via D@@ TD Bear@@ ded D@@ TD settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional ) .
an action can be set with setting actions ... created . click New action results in the same dialog :
&quot; with clicking the user defined button , you can as@@ sign a button to be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cuts are removed . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . there can be a text in the detailed settings and when the action is executed , this text will be inserted in the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . &quot;
&quot; % f : we replace the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document , file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only an instance is running , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , there can be a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection field you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only sensible with this setting .
&quot; according to the input you can also run the output of the executed application . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard error output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode .
&quot; fill out all the necessary fields , and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; edit tag &quot; &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
ill ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graph Other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit Size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with setting actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . beside the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue with other tags , so there is still some , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus functions .
&quot; after selecting the element , which is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to preview a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . anyone who does not know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; in the right folder . after all XML does not exist , it will be stored in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language you like most . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in den &amp; PHP ; documentation as something : &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; note the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself . &quot;
note that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders are shown ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used for designing contex@@ tual sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function would be shown . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file binding lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context items that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c and save to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use .
&quot; if you are sure that these good and worth are shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the ver@@ ging resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else . at different locations there is a menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send tool bar with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case you have multiple keys , you can select one . &quot;
&quot; upload can upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool@@ bars tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signatures . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the name of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package , but creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from D@@ TD shop and conver@@ sions of a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written by this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type Term Title : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 Transitional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically for files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the project folder tree , which em@@ o@@ sta@@ ins the shared use of special tools and patterns . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bars . please hit , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card tracks , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing area lead to another context menu of the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file when the string under the mouse po@@ inter is called a file . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4@@ .01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert into their document , then click on the symbol that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to navigate , to open and strip . in the presentation with map data , files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by linking an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands will open a list of commands in relation to navigation and refre@@ sher of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , you can change attributes and name spaces . the system @-@ aligned entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this card en@@ reiter reveals all the errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will be shown the appropriate command . the cho@@ osen colour of the tool@@ bars is the way to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems while starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product of the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for rapid web development , and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , go to help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not based on the oldest entry .
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on templates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder folder , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board from the cli@@ p@@ board there will be special characters for &amp; HTML ; spelling , so that it will be displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instructions . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; spelling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script outputs error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; when you sign up for this option , you will be charged $ 9.99 each month on your credit card for two months . &quot;
displays symbol columns left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries recorded or next , depending on the location of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
&quot; book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents . &quot;
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO .exe ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; manage the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
load project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you assigned to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team for the tool bar in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
&quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; D@@ TD ; which you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / ref@@ resh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refre@@ shed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew . if this global and a typ@@ ed in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setting dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied , if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules in this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu points above . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in is de@@ activated . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
&quot; choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS , or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
veri@@ fies the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; in the documentation of &amp; kate , you can find details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add them and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the user &apos;s surroundings , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and cens@@ ored , but as with each open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be completed from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , e.g. fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ ars you want to download and change . in server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is re@@ started from scratch , not an@@ hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder , and you can make a precise selection of good th@@ inners . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook , or by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) which will be re@@ loaded with project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to the above , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; for more information about G@@ ub@@ ed , you can find more information about G@@ ub@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building monitor for the content of the server for each profile by pointing a profile view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the saving of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Project ... from the project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project building supervision provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will fade away to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be stored in the core memory , and forget program coding . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk storage option is not available . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o displaced . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply scanning the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has most to do . this helps not only improve productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which are best used by the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition distinguish between tool@@ bars . the addition of tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action can be created . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and set settings for actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially documentation skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions presented at the beginning of each template .
&quot; binary Templates are usually inserted in documents by linking ( e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url ) . some examples are usually found in the template tree under global templates . for more information on the template , tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be compiled from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document , based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ based . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure based on exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select file As a template to save as local template ... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with drag@@ ging and laying on the building supervision templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copying the file only into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; by default , the project folder will be saved , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ type header lines and foot@@ lines or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the folder view and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and adap@@ ts for everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a regular folder would be configured , it would disable templates in this path , unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text blocks . if nothing appears , you will probably find in a root folder . &quot;
allows previous or edited text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p content templates in a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers to provide a whole presentation with the appropriate header lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you can use the context menu ( to press the right mouse button ) to create a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second editor will divide the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cur@@ sor .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the v@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ ame of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it directly with the V@@ PL . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; in addition Michel is speaker , blogger and author of several books . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . if you choose V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; the documentation properties dialog is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the suspension en@@ coding . this can change the following : &quot;
&quot; meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down or removed . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the view of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list .
&quot; it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button , and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processing , by reference with arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves differently . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , each other an anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the sp@@ read@@ sheet assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; you will have to use the tables or lists tool@@ bars in this release .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be tra@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , in one place in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g uploaded style or xml file or at current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , the g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode can be set in a certain file and line number and will be activated later . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path name . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded sty@@ lus file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style sheet file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl is the following entry :
&quot; in this command , it is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a default named QNAP or a given mode name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with each QNAP NAS that contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ espace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the name space defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
this will automatically be re@@ activated when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . why so &amp; more diff@@ use ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly happened within these lines . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare it quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparative windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made much work was the compar@@ ability and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; diff@@ used , almost into a full file browser . &quot;
this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; if you frequently have to check codes , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the indentation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates what file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can make it easier by typ@@ ing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
&quot; open dialogue allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , the compar@@ ision or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A file , for B and C it is a folder , then used &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . &quot;
&quot; the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can specify options before beginning with the Compare / Merg@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor , and drop it over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you cannot remove anything from &amp; diff@@ use ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color .

( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional .
&quot; the three source windows are assigned to the characters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed using the settings menu . ) &quot;
the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is shown in the next section ( Merg@@ ing ) well .
&quot; in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the sum@@ mation column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is displayed at broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the headline issue : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved is the saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use buttons to recover the remaining conflicts in order to find remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two settlement windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first row of the group will appear . &quot;
&quot; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ ings you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; contex@@ tual conflict ; however , it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such a text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if you ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate to the left , right , high , down , side to the left , right , high , down , side down , side down , start , end , Str@@ g @-@ start and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the auction window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert key you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Up / Str@@ g @-@ Picture Up / Str@@ g @-@ Picture Up ) or the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; Unix variants use a line slide character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the lines of source files not running , therefore you should not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu setting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setting up ... )
&quot; select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are shown in a recur@@ sive script . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colours might not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab characters will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when pressing or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system .
only during this first step white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . white signs are ignored .
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic transmission mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will be moved . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are in many files less important . if you are using this only from time to time , then use the functions select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the Merg@@ ing menu . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig file , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global via the control centre . )
&quot; the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file en@@ coding for source files . this influences how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the en@@ coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which en@@ coding should be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
this is also true for changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded transition column . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply ski@@ p the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ start the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; q@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . you can use this feature , for example , to cut distra@@ cting parts or to correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when you read a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only with line spac@@ ing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give users more flexibility when setting di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it yourself . &quot;
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ SW 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ers . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several translations at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the translations from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the pre@@ paid &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . further operations will only change the data that the line of line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line spac@@ ing pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or differences , you may not acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programm@@ ers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders . &quot;
... makes for each object a proposal for mer@@ ging ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ;
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and show the simulated changes without really being carried out .
... &quot; select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or dialog file .
&quot; if there are three folders together , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , used &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the folder scanning , only the files will be listed , which were then compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; col@@ loqui@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file , and every folder of the scan found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click , or use the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ ging action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical , when all content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red is red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C doesn &apos;t exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A doesn &apos;t exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; direct after mer@@ ging &amp; diff@@ . ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( in@@ secure ) , then examine &amp; diff@@ use ; the date of the files and proposes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; during merge , a file will be processed after the other . it status column shows Fer@@ tig when the mer@@ ging was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merger is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is ok . &quot;
&quot; this includes the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only appear if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ ging actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder context C as a target , B is used as a target , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries you should be in the destination folder will be displayed in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to execute only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if there are still invalid combination actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options through , ulating and ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without the really changes , then you will get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window ( note the screen shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , then select / resume a directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to find the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you merge with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) can be found . even if the merge or not been saved , these entries will be considered done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern will appear in the element tree . there can be several patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o .
valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set specific to a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see the info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have an attribute attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; in links to folder : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders with a slow network , it might be faster to compare the ch@@ angel@@ ist and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confi@@ denti@@ ality of the Change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical , if they are equal to the same size . this can be useful for example when copying the ch@@ angel@@ ist date . please use caution . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of combining the newer file as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure as it is assumed that the other file has not changed also . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not just mer@@ ging whole folder . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want this , you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; probably , you prefer to simply compare a file with double @-@ click . you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to run the folder together . &quot;
&quot; this status is lost , however , when you read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : read more &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slave . K@@ itt uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open files that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ one und@@ . or .. . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by using the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; if a link is displayed to a file or folder , there will always be a file as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to process per@@ missions or change dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date vary from the original . ( note the option confi@@ denti@@ ality of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is now as the differences viewer in the Devel@@ op . K@@ DE@@ VELO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then , start &amp; start diff@@ . the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exists . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now hot compli@@ ments ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already pointed out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using G@@ PL programs very long and have learned a lot by using the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or to go .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably not noti@@ fied the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. , diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this node is often the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format , which could save this information . &quot;
&quot; in order to process larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text , suddenly lt ; No src left ; published and the text can &apos;t be cleared . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; in order to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; diff@@ use ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Shift ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current selection .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version version , you need to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the target folder doesn &apos;t contain these files , they will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder doesn &apos;t contain these files , they are missing after the merge . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with caption A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ tones in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , to change their size , to exit or move them . this works both within a working area and several . &quot;
&quot; this can be done from your control panel . if your company is not yet listed , you need to make a listing first . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click , the context menu will only set the two entries P@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this cross panel is selected , window inside the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the names of the virtual desktop are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field allows the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of the virtual desktop . if it is linked together with name , the names are marked with folder numbers , eg . work area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces will appear to allow their selection . &quot;
note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; this can be done from your control panel . if your company is not yet listed , you need to make a listing first . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can change in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up the swit@@ cher ... let the dialog box appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog . you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er.@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic package . &quot;

it is intended to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and those of any mouse click pain .
&quot; it is intended to help people who are suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and it can em@@ ulate the drag@@ ging with the mouse . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the drag@@ ging with the mouse . this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you feel pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking on the mouse , it is against pain caused by the mouse . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse moves and performs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is executed . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , this retention time must be stored before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; if the Intelli@@ gent@@ es move on , the shooting speed is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ressing the mouse button , the mouse button is waiting until the mouse button takes place . &quot;
&quot; these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there Sound System and here the rider General . there is a slider control sound buffer , which you can switch to a lower value to reduce response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , if you &apos;re acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later assume the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ bbing , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse cur@@ ls but also the rolls that come into touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse cur@@ sor . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be quickly clear if you view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you are using the intelligent move , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to stop the release of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a button . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very likely possible to select text to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or run any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift , if you just start with it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , use a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be played every time , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window should be installed . this should be the case on most system . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system has a sound card and speaker , and are set up correctly . &quot;
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , and those who have the right @-@ to @-@ mouse pain . &quot;
&quot; in this way , pulling and laying with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the silent user to talk to their computer . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can talk to the computer for themselves . the user can select phrases from a list of phrases that should be repeated again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for the termin@@ ology . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can termin@@ ate the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only properly letter words can be included in the words of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ ying hub of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences in the input field you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the disk space . you can select phrases that should be repeated again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the site of words and the side of the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map language output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character en@@ coding to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box , if the text should be passed to the language generator as standard input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice @-@ overs depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection panel action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text password menu or in the bar for text password . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel , you can specify whether the text pass@@ code book should be stored automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you select changes , the text@@ pass@@ book book will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right , you can delete or add dic@@ tionaries , modify the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply calculated by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to just insert properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the dic@@ tionaries available . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words are automatically inserted into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text fit holes is divided . in the upper part , the text fit tabl@@ ec@@ l@@ oth@@ s are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated button . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or over a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text fit banners or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected sets of the disk storage will be used . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar by default . clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text fit books with entries is displayed . the bar is positioned directly below the tool bar by default . clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably you don &apos;t have the command for the voice output right or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ exhaus@@ tive , open the General Settings page , and enter the command for voice output on the map language output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware directory . &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ ate , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free of non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ ths and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax does not swal@@ low the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . &quot;

all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use k@@ tt@@ s@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for setting up , use the page K@@ TT@@ ON language service , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use it , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored that the user can always re@@ locate . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed .
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , please refer to help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; - the voice @-@ output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service based on modules of existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
read text ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded .
&quot; speech output takes place via the program speech dispat@@ cher , the various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech @-@ mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Markup Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Markup @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ overs service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; DB@@ us ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of k@@ tt@@ s@@ d via k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for text editor &amp; kate , with which a text file can be read or partially pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ Sharing mailing list , you can also find the list on https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ suites . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you must install program speech dispat@@ cher and set properly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ a or as long as no speaker is set up , the map card will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card will be displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most of the T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
&quot; different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printers , for the same printer . &quot;
&quot; you can always add product news , press releases , events and vacancies completely free of charge &quot;
all previously set @-@ up speakers appear in this list . the top speaker will be used in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ overs when an application does not exist .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a male and female voice . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can almost use . go back to the General Store General tab and check if the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to run . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; click on the map card to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General Manager to open this map . here you can set up some general options . &quot;
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ats ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr is finished , run &amp; kt@@ ats ; further , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click on application or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all pages . &quot;
&quot; ticket orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website first . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; headlines and other invisible brands are also pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read the displayed text . first check the text that is supposed to be read , and select text to be read in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this works even if &amp; kate , embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; which noti@@ fies you about events , and you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IRC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . &quot;
&quot; supports &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which is delivered from &amp; kt@@ ats , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed as assumed as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ats ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the program speech dispat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , choose a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain defects of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the sustained orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot .
&quot; messages have priority priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text assign@@ ments . each order that you invo@@ ke from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one such pre @-@ reads , this issue will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
strings replacing parts of a text by other text .
&quot; &amp; XML ; Trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of supply , some X@@ SL@@ T files are available for translation by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters , which have been set up on the page . editing by the filter will be processed in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the normal filters . if a filter does not cross , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from the top down down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup dialog@@ s are shown below . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . &quot;
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker is speaking for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by commas . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID of running programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; DB@@ us ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered .
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no guide to writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such forms . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c help program needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; set the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify that texts from a female voice should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ats ; a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text is filled with the filtering conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the right to display the selection of speech selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or upload your speech settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box &quot; &quot; Di@@ esen &quot; &quot; if you apply . you must enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with programm@@ ers can lend their applications to T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ ON via &amp; DB@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ats ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bili@@ ty@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program k@@ tt@@ s@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands you can use .
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . just start k@@ tt@@ s@@ d in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr in the other . &quot;
no one of the named speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phon@@ eme so that SA@@ BLE will work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch is issued . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option character en@@ coding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see . &quot;

Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ats ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ bon@@ ding or downloaded every night currently created T@@ arb@@ all , please install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; first check if speech synthes@@ izer works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the establishment of speech dispat@@ cher is possible , and the sp@@ d @-@ conf script is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is divided into single sentences . the user can re@@ write sentence or phrase , repe@@ ating , or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is feminine , this will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; a speaker cho@@ oses , see in . &quot;
&quot; for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown . details about the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; if the path to Festival is included in PAT@@ H , you have to enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; in general , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliders you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few kno@@ bs and show this gray , the voice selected doesn &apos;t allow you to select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when you start K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( for greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet installed a speaker ( or click on users ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked , the program window will be shown k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the section of the system to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr doesn &apos;t work , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just processed sentence . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can set in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text assign@@ ments are listed and managed . output of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information about the types of &amp; kt@@ ats ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ats ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ats ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; set the speaking speed here . 50@@ Hz ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the so@@ x program must be installed . &quot;
click on application to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority .
warnings have priority priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that appeals to messages . if you have just read a long text on a web site , you can be with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add the audio output to the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card board are only valid for normal text orders . for news , warnings and the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start k@@ ett@@ lab@@ y and click noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to turn off &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; read no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications for which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ats ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IRC message .
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ats should do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter the properties of the requested language . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that will appear in the list on the map speaker as top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is specified for a specific application , it is executed . otherwise the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Markup Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for control of voices , speech velocity , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phon@@ etic voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice that the festival is using SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog not on 100@@ mm@@ . % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very monot@@ on@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters , normal filters and stat@@ ute detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . &quot;
&quot; in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ats , you will automatically set up a set @-@ limit identi@@ fier filter . you can change the settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; on the simpl@@ est way , you will learn to set up the choice of choice . switch off the choice of speakers and enter text to read . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; you can stop or break text orders on the map card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the default recognition filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; the text with a regular expression for pro@@ stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( tabs are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default recognition filter keeps the strings attached . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal stat@@ ute detection filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on the map selection list , you can over@@ write the speech settings for the application . the map card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card chart speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaking properties .
&quot; if you don &apos;t delete or edit the settings of the subscri@@ ber , select &amp; kt@@ ats ; otherwise select the speaker , which is most likely to comply with the original properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired ch@@ angel@@ og properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , enter nothing . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also add several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . &quot;
&quot; in order to delete all properties in the area of speaker , which is most likely to er@@ ase the following , click on the standard speaker selection button and then use the speaker , which is most likely to follow below . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; g@@ stre@@ amer is crash and frac@@ tal ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may have an un@@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output above AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes and kt@@ ats ; a message that says : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA that prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . &quot;
&quot; I have invited an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ a does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / k@@ tt@@ s@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices the new voice will be added . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
some Synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are very mu@@ tig , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous . &quot;
I do not create web pages with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the websites with a male voice .

&quot; some users experience AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ats , the current set will be pre @-@ read . &quot;

&quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the correct folder for programs that are translated from the sources . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ats , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS Synthes@@ izer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you need to install at least one language .
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions in passing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ alling . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look at the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option coding must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option coding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyrillic ( e.g. KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R ) . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phon files .
&quot; in this case , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are not installed , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; , then invite MS German Festival of &quot;

&quot; epo@@ xy is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; if the Epo@@ s do not exist in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map speaker . enter in one &amp; Con@@ sole ; e@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a fre@@ eware , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer which is written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java , you cannot set pitch , volume or speech velocity . &quot;
&quot; the command mode allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ats ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one console . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be downloaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
the Network Settings module is loaded when the option Network Settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected .
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the hands @-@ on selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date is best . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are shown gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tabs : &quot;
&quot; the network interfaces are used for managing the network &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . from the server interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
setting the network interface settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button &apos;s interface ... set up in the Device Dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; to display the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are made by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . &quot;
&quot; in the IP address field , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . &quot;
&quot; defines the IP address of the local network , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves DNS names in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; this list can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button ... from the group computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to enter the DNS server &apos;s IP address and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to name resolution , select an entry and then click Edit ... It will display the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list Nam@@ ed @-@ known hosts describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used by the boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list Nam@@ ed contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . &quot;
&quot; enter the IP address of the known machine , and click Add .... The New Alias dialog will be added . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
&quot; select an entry of an especially known calcul@@ ator from the list , and select Edit .... The dialogue box will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found big dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose dedicated to this purpose , to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed to DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the event of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is deleted by the scripts in the Su@@ SE config file . &quot;

the second goal was to create several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick and selective un@@ packing .
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated from &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the band changes to the tape drive , to indicate that the band was involved . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been released and displayed in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band types must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive requires that a tape should be form@@ atted prior to use , it must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a form@@ atting of the band , but DA@@ T drives do not work . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be visible . this can be done on three different types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
&quot; right @-@ click on the local file tree and choose the &quot; &quot; Save &quot; &quot; menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog box opens up . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup procedure , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry Test ...
&quot; once the testing process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , you must mark the files that are to be restored . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape drive unit . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
select the files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
&quot; right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select ... &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , dialog settings will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have veri@@ fied the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process and the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ produce the band index@@ file based on the band content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
&quot; as a result , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be monitored is automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed in backup files , the files that are located on the same file system , such as folders . folder , which are on the same file system , can be found separately under backup files . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ R@@ ew@@ in@@ ding version of the belt .
&quot; in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; tested ; to lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . maybe this setting doesn &apos;t work with all band drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the band will automatically disc@@ ard the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy stream . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is form@@ atted , write a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n bytes ) The Band ID . the format of this string is computer name : seconds , where host name is the complete name of the system in which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ atted since the era in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which are directly associated with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not include incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ through@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system comp@@ utes the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log , is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users will provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can easily filter and sort them . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the system log file - the system protocol . it will not be shown , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ erion , or after entered strings . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry . the string of the filter search term will be selected only with entries in the corresponding column . &quot;
&quot; this option is checked in the default setting , and helps you identify the important protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show a particular process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can ski@@ p the option to new lines in the main window &apos;s contex@@ tual menu to display all the new protocol rows . &quot;
&quot; in order to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well @-@ known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming standard for the control of the program startup at the high @-@ end system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and , because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I am not going to take part in historical aspects here ( for example because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to move a machine on System V In@@ it without having to install a new installation and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you must make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there there . &quot;
&quot; Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub @-@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things like Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . &quot;
&quot; for example , r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line as the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level is 3 . if you want to change it , then you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you &apos;re going to make changes , then you will be able to re@@ start the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simply : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start using these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have a server -@@ Run@@ level that leaves only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another line is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts between Run@@ level , or modify the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if you draw an entry from the area of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and then add to the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to re @-@ establish entries that were thrown into the trash bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the properties dialog . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . Pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I &apos;ve been experim@@ enting with the standard run@@ ways , and now the machine starts to re@@ start . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single , and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to execute Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end without message when their configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly set up .
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , user and user group list . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have added a space limitation ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created for users to make individual adjustments . other cards may appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed in BSD uni@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd will be installed like in BSD uni@@ x . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears , if for at least a lost file system ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user . &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system , and the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation . &quot;
&quot; groups inform@@ s about group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user is , you will find in the Pri@@ m@@ arian group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select addition from the user or group , or click the tool@@ bar to add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager to add , remove and change the boot password , add time to boot the standard operating system , add the default operational system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
