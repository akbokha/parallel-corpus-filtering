<seg id="377">"with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner, and that correspond to the colors that you print or publish in your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide sufficient background information about colour management. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your educational workflow meets all the criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are per e-mail or the web where sRGB is de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB then works well and life for everyone so easy, why should you use another colour space and have to worry about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB colour in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hugely-shaped region, and colours in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colors, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor as sRGB is out of it."</seg>
<seg id="387">"for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants"</seg>
<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"you will have to experiment with these effects, to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scaled down the luminance values above the entire picture, so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest dot as bright as possible without changing its colour shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method precisely adjusts the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a rejifilm of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you are able to perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities to correct corrections will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">"this tool is based on a white balance algorithm, protected by Pawel T. Jochym."</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side, both the original image as well as preview of the target picture can be seen."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"right up, a histogram shows that dynamic changes are changed as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipe. press this button and then click on the image preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The indicator indicator increases colors when more than one colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in white balance. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it into a text file and recharge it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button puts all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you want to save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the coding depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to be found in the menu under Column correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels simultaneously, allowing you to adjust your settings so that you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the sound evaluation correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find gradation in the menu under colours."</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digikam; tool color effects provide you four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the color, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar power. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and this process (2). the applied intensity lies at 30%.</seg>

<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the thickness of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions, so it is not unusual to adjust the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of enhancing them. if you like the result, you can see the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminance / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slide. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpness. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp, and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>

<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharing a photo with the sharpness of sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, the most useful technique for sharpening one image increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus on."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. standard values often generate good results and should first be tried. an increase of radius or the amount increase the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">"high resolution images allow larger radios. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage of the original and the wiped image, which is added to the original. thus, the thickness of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference by using a soft change between the tones of sharpness and thus avoiding blemishes in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred with radios = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these pictures often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and connects Povray; more than one ray of pixels. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively, because the super sampling the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; rewinding, because each pixel is divided over repeatedly and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray will track a beam each pixel. if the difference between the colour values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the predefined threshold, then both pixel will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between colour values exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually tracked and checked by further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1664">"if you want to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM pretends that a keyboard, which is a Pitch Bender event with the value of 4096, is to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards will try to play two tones up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a little with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"and DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folders contain two file types, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folders are handy, symbolic lists of image buttons (above the Editier window), the text and instructions can be inserted faster into a document than a user ever could."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details about converting."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"this document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;"</seg>
<seg id="1997">"TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialoges, the & quantaplus; for the day. the file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow fast inserting tags into a document without risk of a writing error."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)"</seg>
<seg id="1999">"the table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them."</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"this is the root element of a tagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing else than one element type above itself."</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the class class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2005">"if yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)"</seg>
<seg id="2006">This text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a non-element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">"describes an attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it lays the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown & etc; This is a one element element element."</seg>

<seg id="2011">"requires source = DCOP, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, meaning the name of the current tags."</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that collects the elements of a list. it can only occur for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">This tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the tag. this element is a non-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a non-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with an & XML; -Declaration;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"spaces are not affecting anything, but pay attention & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replace this will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"to check the TagXML files, the Tool Dialog Up in & quantaplus is to launch and check tagXML. a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions."</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">This file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be scheme.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as easy and there is an editor for reachable via DTD Bearded DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional).</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with setting actions... created. click New action results in the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">"with clicking the user defined button, you can assign a button to be assigned; with Keiner, the current shortcuts are removed."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"the simplest actions. there can be a text in the detailed settings and when the action is executed, this text will be inserted in the current cursor position. see the example below."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"this is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document)."</seg>
<seg id="2030">"first, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript.sh."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscript.sh."</seg>
<seg id="2032">"% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in the event of a local document, file: / from the document name."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only an instance is running, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"the parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file."</seg>
<seg id="2035">"in addition to the methods listed above, there can be a script input from & quantaplus; in the selection field you can specify what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:"</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only sensible with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"according to the input you can also run the output of the executed application. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages sent to the standard error output."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"fill out all the necessary fields, and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog" "edit tag" "when available so that an input when using the action is possible."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ill! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graph Other programs (or where otherwise it is located in its distribution)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit Size others."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP."</seg>
<seg id="2047">"with regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"after creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with setting actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. beside the text field is a button, press it."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"press the user button and continue with other tags, so there is still some, or confirm with OK to finish."</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus functions.</seg>
<seg id="2052">"after selecting the element, which is to be added to toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I want to preview a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">"please note, as the Trenner support the grouping. anyone who does not know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror is the opposite of the start button."</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"in the right folder. after all XML does not exist, it will be stored in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most worthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language you like most. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"for troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code)."</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in den & PHP; documentation as something:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"for troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code)."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"note the # before getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash, but try it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folders are shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">"spaces affect nothing, but pay attention & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used for designing contextual sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be shown. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separated context items that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these good and worth are shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the verging resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else. at different locations there is a menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), send tool bar with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus users can download them."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case you have multiple keys, you can select one."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"upload can upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload toolbars toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signatures. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the name of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; it is supported to work by creating a DTEP package, but creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from DTD shop and conversions of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written by this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype Term Title: the string that is in! Doctype Tag as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be all of & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special promotions specifically for files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the project folder tree, which emostains the shared use of special tools and patterns."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the building views, the boxes with information and the toolbars. please hit, and for further information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card tracks, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editing area lead to another context menu of the processed document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse pointer or open the file when the string under the mouse pointer is called a file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. as part of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert into their document, then click on the symbol that represents the tag."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building views (QIT;) allow to navigate to & quantaplus, to navigate, to open and strip. in the presentation with map data, files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation are available."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc. all possibilities are open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking on the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"this view shows the internal structure of the active document. by linking an element, the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. by right-click of an element, a list of commands will open a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears under the other tree views. with it, you can change attributes and name spaces. the system-aligned entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus;" documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered. "</seg>
<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantaplus; two boxes at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">"for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2101">"this card enreiter reveals all the errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts which are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window."</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will be shown the appropriate command. the choosen colour of the toolbars is the way to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; for that, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help."</seg>

<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">"during the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus?"</seg>
<seg id="2108">"no longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product of the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed?"</seg>
<seg id="2110">"& quantaplus; allows webdevelopers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well-known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly becoming standard for the control of the program startup at the high-end system in the & Linux; world. and, because it's easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I am not going to take part in historical aspects here (for example because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to move a machine on System V Init without having to install a new installation and reformat. that's why you must make sure the old Init was removed from there, if there was there there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a sub-folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"for example, rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel is 3. if you want to change it, then you can manually edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you're going to make changes, then you will be able to restart the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simply: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start using these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have a server -Runlevel that leaves only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv;. it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another line is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
