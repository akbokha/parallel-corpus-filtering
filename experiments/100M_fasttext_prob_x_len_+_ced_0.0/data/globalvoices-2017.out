&quot; although I have visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , recorded American music , read American writers and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orters covering the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Roberts . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the United States was only reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very sham@@ eful love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most unusual aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and tuned in comments for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes that he won in the Republican presidential elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nomin@@ ee candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ? I asked myself ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalism program that takes people from around the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s view was not consistent with the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who fights for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and the values embo@@ died by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to nom@@ inate Republican presidential candidates , they offered me a halt and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either divided his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters than R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; one of my friends , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ less , and suggests an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( p . O.@@ . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; White against all other ethni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; word game from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the big Van Jones , has just killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , anywhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promises and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , say . &quot;
&quot; at all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had an exchange of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do African Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who doesn &apos;t like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is Tr@@ umps land now , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca and the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arbage d@@ ump , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the church : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for their drug abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; come and play with sparkling eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mbone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from g@@ arbage
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is located at the top of the largest g@@ arbage d@@ ump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ recorded instruments made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ ac@@ ama , where the Recycl@@ er began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , at the beginning : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste produced .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re @-@ recorded material , and the Recy@@ cled Orchestra is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arbage d@@ ump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of g@@ arbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that wild illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the report examines all retail channels to provide sector insight .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a bill of the bill to their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and Sey@@ ch@@ elles were swi@@ ft@@ ly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that had simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; he recalls Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
the core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and protect resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries to stop by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had exp@@ elled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are equally minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , where it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fish@@ eries can harm ecos@@ ystems , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing have been hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those who suggest that a ship will catch his caught fish on the way on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations may show whether the vessels involved have a fish@@ tail license , where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing may , on the basis of this information , refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for punishment , as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worth it finan@@ cially . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , chief director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , losing eight members of the H@@ ansa @-@ i network each year due to illegal fish@@ ers that inv@@ ade in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing companies that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , ph@@ anta@@ sies of ph@@ anta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; Long said . &quot; &quot; before a ship could fly illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You can &apos;t run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found refuge .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; the fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fishing data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be used by satelli@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information planes . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find a crime @-@ operating vessel with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project where a global system permits the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only sense criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships formerly used without license , and hardly had consequences , know that they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile reached a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats have purchased more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;

&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to allow more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot;

&quot; after the government refused to request the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded to the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis by gathering itself on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezu@@ el@@ an ( for example , the rep@@ atri@@ ation of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things , in the flat landing area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north @-@ located Bundestag , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which makes it noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the presi@@ dency of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the sec@@ rec@@ y of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government statement as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % for the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new governance . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine town of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a now adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of C@@ ór@@ doba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not look for his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept family secrets reserved for himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was al@@ right . &quot;
I felt like a secret .

&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ ologist . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of Intelligence Department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
&quot; everyone named him &quot; &quot; Kent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what to do , but I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me that I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners were tor@@ tured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; in the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a sent@@ ry . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; the prisoners were tor@@ tured , and the prisoners were tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch that was tor@@ tured in the people . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal @-@ fe@@ athers .
&quot; later , I found out that it was attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body , which was tied up there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely tie a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , shot him with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were faced with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people sat quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What are you doing so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a pit , and killed by soldiers and buried . &quot;
I know this because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero beat a man and killed him . &quot;
&quot; ( according to the survivors of survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , was sentenced to death by the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Bast@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , conduc@@ ts the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way to which the kidn@@ app@@ ings came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; if they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be transferred . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Battle of the Battle &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things at home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war of war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I knew that war was a bay@@ onet or perhaps military insignia which you fought with an enemy whom you fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is ste@@ aling .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; and you , who steal cars on the street ? &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
&quot; he exploded in rage , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and move yourself . &quot;
we need no one else to do this !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of the time I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence was accused of being a con@@ cili@@ ator in this crime . I said no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testi@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
did these people not even have families with whom they could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that can be done to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grin@@ ded and found somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; one will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I even enjoyed the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ ach because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed nobody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked myself why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me this ?
I saw how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed atro@@ cious crimes , and you forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; Well , show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I bought the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .

&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , last month witnesses of a very un@@ fortunate translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word has been translated elsewhere ( kor@@ ei@@ sha sha ) , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; - perhaps even with mal@@ ign@@ ant rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the first to 20th of September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ otos , who was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , though gramm@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked to their accuracy before it was published . &quot;

the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News tac@@ kl@@ ed somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , however , is quite a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a share of 10 % . &quot;

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are varied .
&quot; to transfer , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate into French into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , make translations still fir@@ men@@ internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English language skills are the best , are made to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and enig@@ matic sentences , which arise through machine translation , show that this technology cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;

&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry , or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;

Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would have no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet entries of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online channels carried photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who oppose Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros &apos;s government .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites ven@@ yp@@ ol@@ ean providers are locked once again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet internet , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
it &apos;s amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ o later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly is transfer@@ ring their meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or deny the request when calling such a page . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the broadcast aired on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , so that the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage on the current events in the country . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a review of the first edition published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling schools , &quot; edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; what has become of something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes away her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more wealthy family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do house@@ work for a number of days , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta , especially young girls who were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the belief that they can finish their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with herself and justi@@ fies her exploitation with faith , is that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl becomes ill , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , is a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 km east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until it suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the young girl &apos;s life .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was a cri@@ tique .

the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to inf@@ lict the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded speedy investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was her Cri@@ tic , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be fur@@ ious - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all work and started selling candy in the street or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time that she was still learning time for learning . &quot;
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days , for example , clean@@ sed the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more it was done with learning , the more leisure she had . &quot;
but this time too was limited because she had to make supp@@ er for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the land@@ lord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand alongside him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the land@@ lord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; bad habits there . &quot; &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ ani , would speak to her native Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made , and they explained . &quot;
&quot; however , she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mob@@ bing and the sham@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ tique . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody at home . I had no circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the society endor@@ ses Cri@@ mean az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share a job advertisement for cleaning personnel and child girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; heads &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest @-@ year girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
the report examines all retail channels to provide sector insight .
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we made it possible to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice of the Spanish con@@ quer@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ an@@ í ) and the system of the M@@ ens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as Hal@@ b slaves ) . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register at the government

notify me of new posts by email .
&quot; sixty @-@ five Egyptian MEPs have recently approved a bill to regulate regulation regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be established , which is mand@@ ated to use citizens to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with adoption of the law , users and users have to register on the site with their right names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months or a bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragraph and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used on the internet to communicate with others by voice , video content and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the users and users . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to control regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary member and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly in technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forced to control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will be able to set up a strong surveillance system to file citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the desktop , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; &quot; thre@@ aten public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exac@@ erb@@ ate &quot; &quot; protest . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , who was in the last six years , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident occurred in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ agi Pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighboring pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was still experiencing a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved for six years in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( Reutlingen , Donet@@ sk , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ agi , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , one still endeav@@ ours to settle for six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by bin shel@@ ters ( obli@@ que Municip@@ alities , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ te ak@@ u ) into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelter accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people living in Mi@@ y@@ agi , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such kind . &quot;

the work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts nearly 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have attracted large @-@ scale agricultural land in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ agi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that it is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; Nuclear Power Zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered substantially , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in their introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .

how about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness of the worst , catastro@@ phic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced ever . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , something more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , have been res@@ ett@@ led to permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 state of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which are still in dwelling houses , are older than 50 years old . they are known to be due to the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 in Tokyo . &quot;
the World is Small : our pod@@ cast &quot; Into the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one realis@@ es that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of Into the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look at these global connections . in our Into the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;

Cuba and the United States : a danger for both EU and the UK
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills joined the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no significant sugar @-@ picking on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane mills .
&quot; after the rest , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding made of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some altern@@ ated the work .
others re@@ signed and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; veteran , a soldier veteran who runs every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; n@@ ene recalls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry imp@@ airs the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades , but the poor harv@@ ests are already no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Shortage and Overeducation
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar market crisis on the global market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will remain per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Rural Soci@@ eties &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring started in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would only be removed in relation to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Tor@@ o , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters were becoming more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for the sugar cane mills used in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he removed one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work lat@@ tice was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work places and services that were created in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the President in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane plant closed , or better said , when they began to gr@@ ind it , they also stopped to p@@ aved the road , and this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they were spare parts .
&quot; without future prospects , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working . &quot;
nin@@ ety @-@ nine yields bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ um .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ cing person , but he gives the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
&quot; at 65 years old , n@@ ene is reti@@ ring , not because it is lacking in strength , but because he is bit@@ terly . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture

photo used by N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do it by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour since 2014 , we have been offering mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives and lives in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop concludes that the young participants in discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into meaning . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ um@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen most indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ en@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the chorus is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the you@@ ths involved received some help from Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is in tran@@ script , just as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever was interested in me
&quot; but I try to continue my days on earth , &quot;
that &apos;s the day you &apos;ll hear our scre@@ am
&quot; because we have lost our way in life as a youth , &quot;
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so they can grow , and as well as our youth &quot;
&quot; in this way , they can do what they intended the creator . &quot;
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and advocate of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes a contribution and adds the verse in Sil@@ en@@ eum ( which is also published on his blog , and is published here with approval ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be displayed near the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( as weil extern@@ alizes reliably , &quot; &quot; Plasma models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the town of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are many of these small businesses that produce plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the Blogger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sales : new plastic straps decorated with plastic straps decorated in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , such as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ck@@ away fridge magnet mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in this case , a Kais@@ a @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was converted into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ebook for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ical .
&quot; in this case , I@@ kur@@ a and salmon roe are used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic bags can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest cell stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more quir@@ ky plastic dishes , please visit : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # random@@ twe@@ et@@ ail@@ topic . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . such as the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; ( to create paragraphs , you simply leave blank lines . ) &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ eries and kill@@ ings often appear only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the mour@@ ners or the con@@ greg@@ ations who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican News Portal Animal pol@@ í@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; &quot; ap@@ ort a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; living with drug trafficking &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how Fear Life has changed &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Gu@@ adal@@ upe , a father who finds secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only a single day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ adal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on 13 October , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you stand the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a mort@@ g@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ ort a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who pose to fear . we must show the conflicts , fra@@ gi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader from Animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been known for the disease and sens@@ ational journalism for a couple of years now .
&quot; I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot;
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they hated those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic .
the lack of human dignity is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbourhood would be justified that they were &quot; ung@@ rat@@ eful . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact ourselves if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; I have asked myself in these terrible days if wines would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organized crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as , and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot;
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines . this project reminds us of those we can &apos;t forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; ap@@ ort a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; Animal pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journalism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words , &quot;
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages linked to it include images that are depicted on violence .
the fac@@ t@@ check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist further . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ ting trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for images to news . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the East of DR Congo , til@@ ted around and exploded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected and destroyed . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the fuel car dropped to the victim . &quot;
&quot; the government representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who watched the soccer world champ@@ ionships . &quot;
houses burned and cor@@ rupted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture of the title &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of cab@@ al bodies , which are raised on the ground while people watch them . &quot;
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was ti@@ pped several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burned and cor@@ rupted in streets and b@@ ushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 @-@ 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were torn , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time was exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Nig@@ eri@@ an army and the attempt by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as it fal@@ sely presented evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a series of de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented the assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was taken as a receipt for mass@@ acres . &quot;
&quot; even one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely mistakenly fal@@ si@@ fies the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
Vali@@ date@@ err@@ or@@ pages Verb@@ ose@@ Output Clean up Markup with HTML @-@ Ti@@ dy Help on the options is available . congratulations
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were allowed to flee were drow@@ ned , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arabic news page , which fal@@ sely claimed to be President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being , monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false data
traces of these fake cou@@ gh@@ s reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from everywhere around the world .
&quot; by using a &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far beyond borders can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; the search interface PubPsych offers an easy to use search interface in English , results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mask of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , some others tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have nar@@ rowed examples of mis@@ use use and brought them into contact with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also linked in some cases ) , several examples of mis@@ use use may come from . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( shown on the map in Orange ) :

&quot; in this article , a blogger from Quebec City is not only interested in fal@@ si@@ fication but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an abu@@ sive use of the image of the DR Congo , on the one hand , a twe@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger , the asser@@ tions , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued to del@@ igi@@ tim@@ ate , since the photos have been mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a judge called &quot; deliberately f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judge , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors that operate H@@ ate Speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is your father &apos;s name ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this post , directed at the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
&quot; this message was fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein , in 2012 , claimed that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , has explicitly stated that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later linked to the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; # Ni@@ yon@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is sleeping ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this Twit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities of these events , which were pres@@ sur@@ able in the name of Islam , had a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a receipt for the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times to retwe@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with that were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ anced . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ - / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and they have some date names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared first on the original piece of 2010 , the picture eventually carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the ord@@ n@@ ance of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is subject to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understands and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of mis@@ understand@@ ings and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ row@@ ly sme@@ ars the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
the spread of violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that holding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images of readers and viewers can des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study which examined how violent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot of discussion about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to reflect on the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can be used in the context or completely abu@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , each investigation of false ten@@ ders should also take account of how international it can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; this Blog will give regular Com@@ ment@@ ators Do@@ Follow Status . implemented from IT Blö@@ gg , &quot;

the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and disaster disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon that normally uses end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement of the catastro@@ ph@@ es of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and hundreds of people were missed due to floo@@ ds and mud . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places . &quot;
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water resi@@ du@@ es in some areas slow@@ ed slowly .
health and hygiene standards of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :

many use H@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
&quot; on the other hand , there is no doubt that this is not the case . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in flood water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
&quot; in addition , various organizations and venture leaders have also been able to help . &quot;
&quot; in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief efforts , Facebook pages like Help F@@ lood Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood protection and humanitarian aid . &quot;

&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring residents in need of security and make aid measures . &quot;

&quot; in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children : she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we c@@ ater rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umb@@ rel@@ las and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scarf high , bound by an American flag , others channel slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years , separated me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they mus@@ li@@ m me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims do not fit , they will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
to be un@@ mus@@ cled
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come into mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries . &quot;
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should be afraid of and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid took the story behind these pictures in the 1970s . &quot;
but these pictures grow even today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I saw how this powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ ra@@ tives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ ra@@ tives over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the past three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ ra@@ tives fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings , Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong fol@@ ly weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ ra@@ tives has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ anti @-@ Muslim attacks and attacks . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell them and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create sc@@ ars that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest grade &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of an Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslim if they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I climb her in my arms and whis@@ per the Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and be called Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the picture of my grandmother m@@ üt@@ ter@@ li@@ ken on both sides with her sisters ; as they win a contest of the art of the flower arran@@ ger in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
&quot; it is the image of her that I can see at this moment , when I close my eyes : n@@ ano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that they can almost utter . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an what God means is my only Lord .
&quot; it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time see that my ad@@ vers@@ ed grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of Kash@@ mir@@ i , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt over his family in India dominated Kash@@ mir , family , who had not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
it means knowing that the first plane bomb of history has been ej@@ ected from a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; since he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread across each continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , had gone into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy strikes the US and carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that before four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .

&quot; the scar@@ ce of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduction of twi@@ sting &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House . &quot;
&quot; they are grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story I am not aware of when I was so old , as it was my daughter , but who made me an innocent Muslim . &quot;
&quot; in my speech , things I left here like a crust of bread in my speech . &quot;
&quot; things that may wake up memories , as in all the inter @-@ fac@@ tions that constitutes our humanity , a story may lie , where one is made to one another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia take place . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I were in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we did not have a president , the chocolate cake , while he was already bombar@@ ded with broken lands and &quot; &quot; to other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
the initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Flickr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not based on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages will not be passed to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided , when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listen often with it , &quot; these events instead &quot; hear these events instead &quot; listening to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers will first translate their history in their own language , or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and representation will lead to the audience &apos;s audience . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain typical customs of story@@ telling . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ath@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ath@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad grin , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siv@@ ity : &quot;
they have listened to !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language stories have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own history of history . &quot;

&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which started on 72 million US dollars , on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration . the march started at the pu@@ er@@ anian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;

the advoc@@ ates of the new suspension of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a solid , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .

&quot; the Syri@@ ac Palestinian Web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; in this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is available in license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it means : &quot;
&quot; this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the true costs are with which it is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet @-@ volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was kn@@ itted from the A@@ dra prison directory , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us can start thinking about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ism has been in custody since March 2012 in custody of Syrian government authorities .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they were contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and they were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes was more than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that embo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project until now . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life , dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to hu@@ g them . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 , when he was detained . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
they smug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excer@@ pt from the book from Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I have failed in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gonna do , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the prison prison
&quot; and I went into every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
&quot; that I carry with passion with me , &quot;
&quot; when your eyes say goodbye , &quot;
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I will return soon to my soli@@ tude , &quot;
&quot; in order to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s arrest , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
during the day
&quot; I &apos;m in your cage , &quot;
and you &apos;re still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time .

&quot; with anger on a corruption case , Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released due to good leadership in 2016 and immediately demanded his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19th . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which evalu@@ ates the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to get back to his old post since the company was no disciplinary proceedings after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t call the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re@@ locate the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we note is that the company should have had a disciplinary procedure against the re@@ sist@@ ing .
&quot; the company kept silent , however , and failed to take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also refuses this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and served by half . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could be advised and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not say any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ult@@ ed him , I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded with someone in such a way that the state already has mas@@ sively ins@@ ult@@ ed the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to recall the prime minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only for the first independent president , but also as sharp , ed@@ gy and - by the way , proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely down@@ ward con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ still may usually be associated with racism , but the word of itself doesn &apos;t automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt about his use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic meanings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , a chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar amic &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ch@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words by the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word game . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they reduce hate language radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook should be more analytical than to spread all posts made in the suspicion of spreading racism . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what it should take instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words of the words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( ages ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate language , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise its nationalism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , and users of social networks simply start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t consistent . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail ( will not be published ) ( required )
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and prohibited such words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the deleted messages . &quot;
&quot; if they had a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; instead of taking it serious , users are now fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that don &apos;t contain hate speech , but they have been removed : &quot;
with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and look at an Indian movie .
&quot; only to try out if Facebook removes the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate language in social networks is to hei@@ ghten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of refugees to flee . &quot;

&quot; but rather than just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , more focused on context than on code concent@@ rating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state would not interv@@ ene since that , at age , does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , every person under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed to aboli@@ sh laws for children , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hind@@ u leader , for instance , had no qual@@ ms to say the critics of the children &apos;s wo@@ e , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the children before - despite the 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law . &quot;
&quot; now only the president of the country must agree , and let the law announce the law . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child labour was adopted at the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft may now become a law . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who has a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary bar@@ ge that has conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price . &quot;

the sp@@ ouse etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , but it is not a matter of fact . &quot;
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , it is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years . &quot;
&quot; the draft on the amend@@ ment of the sp@@ ouse was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 of them were present in the vote . &quot;
all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hind@@ u organisation in the country . &quot;
&quot; before months Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial proceedings , the law should be passed , and he seems to appro@@ ve his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the Attorney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate about the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we take place instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace if we , instead of talking about the problem that we , to invite the state into our bedrooms , would simply be talking about that the state , our daughters to be ab@@ used , would be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children in different gra@@ dations are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; in China , Turkey is the second best known country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform is still closed , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) have appeared . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform was supported by all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer host connections ) , which is not based on domain names and makes a complete c@@ ensu@@ s difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we heard the news ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to place Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with badly positioned moti@@ fs and well @-@ washed colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to gra@@ pple the situation .
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , as it helps him achieve this first @-@ class position in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just re@@ sted at home when suddenly Navar@@ ra ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; immediately I ran off with my camera , and was there in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look like .
&quot; and he should know , for he was standing on faces from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t interfere with the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ k appeared . he inst@@ alls , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid having the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect their husband because of social pressure , and fear of the consequences should be ignored by the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also is not mentioned in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less allow@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not meet this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly become the main topic of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss and discuss the fin@@ ties of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates for the destruction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them become ambass@@ adors of the change .
&quot; the first video , which showed the Roh@@ ini in its discussion round , acted by women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she has decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the names of their hus@@ bands , it is a custom that they all du@@ ly maintain and never questioned . &quot;

this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes a long life .
a woman who does not keep this is regarded as being questioned as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ w@@ right from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women must never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover
&quot; a woman was so inti@@ mid@@ ated , that she was only dressed in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole planned fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin rush of having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the chin @-@ red spot on the foreh@@ ead , showing E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the interest of interest in the interest of interest . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say something loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have taken sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ em Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t we@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own clothes selection , the mor@@ als combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini put their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ isph@@ eres ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to create it . &quot;

we have only done little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it even , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the steep for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting on the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
&quot; but this club , each of us gives us confidence that something will change . &quot;
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ orative celebration
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the Beat@@ les official YouTube channel .
&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag shifted perio@@ dic@@ ally encased Rathgeber ( Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese turn through . &quot;
the people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous japan@@ ese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Holdings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; * Just a quick thank you for the software though , It &apos;s not often you get a free software version of this quality and style ! well done and please continue this amazing gallery . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ ao@@ ke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is celebrated . &quot;
we all love Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll will represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ mag@@ es to the famous places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love Beat@@ les , you are your 5 places you must visit obli@@ ques &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ mag@@ es sometimes cannot be bizarre enough :
&quot; Nov 6th 2016 , 5 : 27@@ pm &quot;
&quot; today , Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is celebrated . &quot;
&quot; in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies use the fans in marketing , like this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is going to go today .
so we hope you are there !

the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that flat @-@ headed men could be attacked in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of flat @-@ headed persons for organ trafficking , pres@@ um@@ ably for dis@@ believing purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometres from the border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi were used .
&quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man can enth@@ use gold or bring wealth , the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia announced the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on flat @-@ headed men have been registered in Moz@@ ambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of exec@@ uting exec@@ utions for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be Wey@@ a lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; on the other hand , there is no doubt that men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the mos@@ ambique police ra@@ ided the most up @-@ to @-@ date er@@ ections of three gl@@ amor@@ ous men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two suspects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the mur@@ ders were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ens Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police have already been following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of flat @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a County , the province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men were killed with hair failure in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ gers Po@@ lic@@ eman Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ IE E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH ash@@ amed a country where the people would be ash@@ amed to go on the street , as if they were ash@@ amed of the shooting of a porno@@ graphic in which the teachers would be ash@@ amed of having sex against good marks or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted to get their own riches . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter us@@ erin , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both flat @-@ headed : &quot;

the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community , after his lawyer announced late June that he had been admitted to hospital for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( stat@@ ute ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that had demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and told a spokes@@ woman , &quot; &quot; he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China will continue to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to go abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out of the issue . &quot;

&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , since exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his arrest , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;

&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Republic of the Republic , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dal@@ ai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foo@@ lish as Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he under@@ lines that Singapore should be considered as a city .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; this is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable country , you can say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he was inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er emerg@@ es from author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leaving the dist@@ orted logic , as it adap@@ ts to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am was given answers to his American guests about our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really no answers . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he did not know what he was talking about . &quot;
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , provided it was highly paid to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; as An@@ on publi@@ shes his comment on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire co @-@ writing of the conference so that one could understand the context of the statements made by Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the manuscript .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compar@@ es Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , who , as a leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what a@@ waits me - unless I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review explores the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &quot; &quot; gut@@ ted a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud spokesman ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singap@@ or@@ ean do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink HR ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have been anno@@ yed many Singap@@ or@@ ean ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .

&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

&quot; the question I asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 , I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .

I hate that .

&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would switch to Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be sk@@ ill@@ ful - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian double lon@@ er ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
to be harm@@ less means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no need to pay attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans often talk about the fence around the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friend@@ liness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right .
music video of a pop band par@@ ody by Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ed in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reg@@ ain the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tattoo colors describes a young man who tells the rules he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expres@@ sly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;

the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ sist@@ ently pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief an absolute decision @-@ making power over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous programme of &quot; &quot; adjustment change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered to be critics of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army to monitor online content and individuals who are accused of having committed the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , a strict la@@ yo@@ ff against &quot; &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) . &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup in the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase was unnecessary and a waste of tax relief . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even shows how people will be thrown into a black delivery van before entering into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly have &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the mon@@ archy . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ rupt war was officially completed , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ sum@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ra@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ kh@@ si@@ ans , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked to Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of Russians and tur@@ tles live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ aca Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these ho@@ stages . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after it had barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centers , schools and nur@@ sery schools , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only a p@@ aved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
&quot; in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;

many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ suffici@@ ency ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican girl , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot;
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , tells Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication that they cannot pay , she mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ sam from the long journey of exhaus@@ tive feet . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a very short time . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a jo@@ ie sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explained Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers at construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; for months , he has been guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I wonder if he will contact Frau Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always remain in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to kiss her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken and Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only radio hope for migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a blind al@@ ley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have received migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ out money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a remote @-@ drawing , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps are to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the passages , the travelers cons@@ ulate quietly to their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she sc@@ rolls in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ band , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , young and old . &quot;

&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;

&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app could determine and track the sources and the deployment paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; damaging information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on online and to remot@@ ely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in a variety of ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in eastern and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority areas like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often classi@@ fy extreme cens@@ uses and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;

&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the &quot; sleep or death &quot; series , in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has resolved and dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth revealed , which is clearly recogni@@ zable , both internally and extern@@ ally . &quot;
one that makes her name all honor .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if the reality returns you and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything sh@@ outs after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke , and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ ls . you will realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; as the head of the Security Council form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; sh@@ outs .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods are cov@@ eted , only my own is not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city , which is op@@ ted up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had calm down after the power supply was stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I went through the silence by crying out several times &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice ech@@ o@@ ing through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were allied to a magnificent image that filled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t care in the ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make ready , we meet with military security buildings . &quot;
he laid down .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you back your voice , after you have taken the whole way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to cry when we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his hate @-@ filled eyes set up on me .
&quot; and you &apos;re really sad to see me in the eyes , not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was at my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret the word of what I said . &quot;

&quot; his father is equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed stat@@ utes lies in me until now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; a psychological torture that I was subjected to months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office I leave everything , what I wear with me . &quot;
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sex@@ y@@ Manu@@ ela is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately set myself without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ first &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , no one of the surrounding cells was a respected man of middle @-@ aged middle @-@ aged , who looked similar to me and called &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness no distinctive facial features can be seen , and doctors are not available here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be interrog@@ ated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ oured in the fruits of my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still listen to &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es sound , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; recording on the 13th of the Qur &apos;an ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; in order to protect the state security from us and to prevent the betra@@ y@@ als and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their den@@ omin@@ ational black@@ mail card and revealed the close eye view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that slide him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to stop this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished , even though I did not have done anything to make this punishment . &quot;
&quot; in all their diversity , punishment in all their diversity . &quot;
his command is to pull me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the Klo@@ sters . &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ic@@ eth in your cry .
&quot; give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t hold your cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a g@@ arbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables together in order to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the series . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling , and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ors , why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half naked body , which was stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot;
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with thee , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth : &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me free .
where do they lead me ? !

Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib spent most of his time inside ; sometimes he picks up his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has been one of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned its old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deal with themes such as Oriental , racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees himself as a person who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel with the people affected by the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he h@@ ates a particular reluct@@ ance against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; &quot; Palestinian poultry man of the second generation &quot; &quot; - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sol@@ dered N@@ esc@@ af@@ é into two cups . it is the Holy Month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically speaking , the wig lies warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one thro@@ ws a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one avo@@ ids it simply to do basic things - as to the public during Ram@@ adan &apos;s water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert show . &quot;
&quot; the members and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the old @-@ time legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; which continues to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be easy to be sil@@ ly rhet@@ oric , but actually reflects a clear cryst@@ alli@@ sing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib restored traditional sex or@@ gas@@ ms by creating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they actually should trust . &quot;
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Honor@@ ary mor@@ se &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still being said that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support adequate means . &quot;
&quot; according to a law of crime @-@ fighting in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can be held at in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family are necessary that the woman is not going to happen . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to be afraid not to shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is his music that is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was tor@@ tured in politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib accepts the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
IPTC : caption Dre@@ dg live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse repe@@ ats itself often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib was an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were taken from the context , twisted and cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib adverti@@ ses openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ a , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , later on to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can they not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service took several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason that they were critically critic@@ ised in social media , which are related to the problems rooted deeply in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs shows only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this way it sees H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ ib aspi@@ res , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only to bring his work to Baghdad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will embrace a real and fundamental openness through music , art and literature - and not by bombs , bombs and artificial art . at least , he hopes it . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , H@@ da@@ ib will further escal@@ ate and therefore also resist opposition . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is believed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two wag@@ ons are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession as the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street gangs and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
there are experts against each other to show who can create the ec@@ centric looks like you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year started in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love with the children we have built this education community . &quot;

why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel like being aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( Letters to Recon@@ ciliation ) , which encouraged young people to write letters . &quot;
&quot; after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla guer@@ ri@@ lla F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) that forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;

&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : till now thousands of young people have written letters - messages of love for former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who will then be handed over personally . &quot;

&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love , write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he continued to share his love with people this year , which needed the most pressing response . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to send letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC decided to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of shelter from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life a person has written something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot;
&quot; I emb@@ raced him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this comb@@ at@@ ant , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had expected anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the hunger death . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all raised up as a war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice eman@@ ated from the state to the whole Colum@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people who have never found hearing and have no right to vote , and to recognize that the people whom I often have seen as monsters , and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ts me that all men - even those who killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters asked the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans proph@@ es@@ ied that after dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are willing to seize the arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we are now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those among us who defend life as a foundation of existence will be im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hang@@ s like a dam@@ o@@ kl@@ essness above the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about overnight . &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international headlines after several months after reports released , which themati@@ zed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested gay men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ gres@@ sman , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens of the inter@@ course of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of their lives , they moved to the United States last ends . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ gres@@ sman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 9 , 2011 &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything together and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you placed - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful for him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they put absurd demands : some told me , I must prove it by running above without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , saying that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have a grain size C - what would I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only your family but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate sign with a 95 on it . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a little lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without regi@@ stering , without reference , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the g@@ arbage .
came up and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know what hotel you are talking about . you even know your room number .
&quot; only to prove it , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the inter@@ course of sex , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I &apos;m really hard to see how the person re@@ members from her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed here ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week .
&quot; for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked with someone who had sc@@ anned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced blood . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there is not a lot of people there .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives , in order to put Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there was nothing new about them ever since .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to sh@@ ave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
&quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot;
&quot; I think that before 2003 , I was already known throughout the Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in serious !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much more secure than now . &quot;
&quot; in the end , Russia wanted to bring us back to the &quot; civili@@ sation , &quot; but finally left us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had painted eyel@@ ashes and tu@@ b@@ bled jeans and shorts .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never bent over a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , when they mo@@ urn over the sick . &quot;
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes closed to you because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov joined the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had vent@@ ured and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I guide them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for a long time .
&quot; I have discovered these people myself , when I cl@@ amp@@ ed Zu@@ z@@ ap@@ per@@ te . &quot;
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ go ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; this is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to proph@@ esy with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no gay bars . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner , which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
I &apos;ll meet so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think at transi@@ ent identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not be ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all . I just know that I am myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the em@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the picture of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ ell@@ i on August 27 re@@ marked the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ rie was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; the video kept on YouTube , when he had ign@@ ited himself . &quot;
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ occ@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide , which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on site warn against the fact that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month , some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , they felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job . &quot;

&quot; the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy assumed power and 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most precious and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs systematically to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of tribes , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only managed to make the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ v@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the mind of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
Do@@ of him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse now . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the sett@@ ling process :
&quot; as function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to jobs in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i , because even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i has to end@@ ure , human rights activists strike alert before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ idable .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought @-@ through scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be feminist and why we should be all femin@@ ists in general . &quot;
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money nowadays despite the same education as men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ old among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I am talking to skin color , on racism , black women , black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racism and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women should come together to &quot; &quot; raise their voices and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; , &quot; to reach equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women at two times . &quot;
or about the fact that black women and women of other ethnic and her@@ edit@@ ary people earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with migration background often referred to school as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , which refuses to take into account injus@@ tices in their mind , which relate both to gender and skin colour . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a feminist @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical and margin@@ alised being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that , moreover , absorb our customs and customs to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ cutting skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself full of femin@@ ism and to join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming yourself ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his municipality . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work focuses on persec@@ uted , little substantial sub@@ cultures and is characterised by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities , their stories in their way . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ los@@ sy ) that reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time passed and the police said that their testimony would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , the Ac@@ ten@@ ded ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved her ad . &quot;
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are offen@@ ded at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on the men they abuse . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers currently available are alarm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Attorney General of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of Hizb ut Tahrir / Wilay@@ ah Pakistan conven@@ ed . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace pris@@ ons . 86 % of women were used here .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot;
&quot; there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
&quot; ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 7 ( Greek ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 ( Hebrew , visual ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 9 ( Turkish ) &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay on the basis of violence by men . &quot;

un@@ seen mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she gave up . this should always be regre@@ tt@@ able . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but for two years she brought the psychological violence on its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious ones : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long ago , and didn &apos;t leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the yo te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything started with mental abuse . &quot;
her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ meas@@ urable legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; China , People &apos;s Republic of &#124; Beijing Branch Office &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad@@ vert of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the use of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for@@ YOU ) . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain the fem@@ icide on a self @-@ perpet@@ ual crime and to pun@@ ish the har@@ sher as it is in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the Legis@@ l@@ ature has changed in some respects to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , fear@@ ing that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alising abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had been en@@ vis@@ aged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) travel costs that have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just provide an ad and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot;

&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , that force is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; in the face of these facts , the perpet@@ rators are guilty and contribute to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are punished . &quot;
&quot; we must restore so long , until mi@@ stre@@ ating is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law have been changed . &quot;

&quot; since 1970 , Oman is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid ibn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has been suffering from his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterised by the harsh efforts of the security forces , especially of domestic intelligence , public freedom , including press freedom , including press freedom , freedom of press freedom , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , inti@@ mid@@ ating and incar@@ cer@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closing and detention three of its editors last year , is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper published since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties bind hands of justice &quot; in the paper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;

&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information provided the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ kat the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the newspaper &apos;s final closure .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were convicted , among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of a ban and s@@ lander . &quot;

&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement by which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the minister ordered another time against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman .
&quot; further violations include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ore and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Syrian authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Syrian authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promp@@ tly and un@@ condi@@ tionally released ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . to protect the freedom of press freedom in the country , and &quot;

medical Research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with its consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : there are two reasons why there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic was first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the Pennsylvania University , he resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
GV : what are your opinion on the important current science topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recep@@ tion@@ ist instead of being M@@ acher yourself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what &apos;s the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems world @-@ wide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has bred salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ Insert , the first plant that has grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only limited by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sage types he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more o@@ int@@ ments were patented and that he could not use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents tend not only for individual species but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or m@@ illed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs salads , he needs to be more difficult for it , since his work is becoming more and more difficult for his work . &quot;
it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der would lie in a river that I have to d@@ ump into .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new salad variety because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the ISS International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot;
&quot; it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SSI , U.S. bre@@ eders may commit that other seeds can be freely used by them . &quot;
&quot; Hemp exhibition , museum of natural history Fribourg , CH Book for children , 1920 Bot@@ anic representations &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
No@@ err Firm of the year for the Mittelstand Men@@ old Be@@ z@@ ler Startup
&quot; for the Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madison and O@@ SSI board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter , or only little , by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that other seed companies are still freely available , as opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited , is constantly shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SSI , has engaged in their doctor@@ ate with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that massive con@@ gest@@ ed plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are grown so far@@ med that they have specifically desired characteristics - such by which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; against this background , papers focusing on reasons for , or on results or measurement of such matching problems are particularly welcome . call for Papers 12th IWH / IAB @-@ Workshop on Labour Market Policies Online Survey of the IAB web presence &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto said that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property enters other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not in@@ hi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years waiting until a patent expi@@ res . certainly no innovations .
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we do not create the features ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them , and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , Plant bre@@ eder in the US state of Oregon and O@@ SSI board member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; anyone who is growing a variety is also breeding his own values . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for their cultivation of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , growing in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they create the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is for 20 years protected from competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on a &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ SSI commitment cannot simply be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventional far@@ med plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Douglas , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which planned next year will be the official start of the start . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the International Non@@ profit Development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database for seed and bi@@ odiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI , hopes that more people will see him soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially respected where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make clear to the people that even more behind their food . &quot;

&quot; however , the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities had sharply critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; even though it was never so difficult to pursue these goals , it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles he wrote for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog he set up to deal with the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he talked about the student protests and took a video as police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the locking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ Sis@@ i &apos;s era ; and even if locking the blogs may not become significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been successful to give me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , loading of the national security council , locking blogs and any other web site for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , albeit only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; now however , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave men go their way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24th May to 06 August 133 websites . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
af@@ te reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s . &quot;
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian people no legal basis with which they can proceed against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it be attacked next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

&quot; day for day newspapers in all Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard moti@@ fs . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; on the other hand , the United States and the United States have made a significant contribution to the development of nuclear weapons , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are common@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; this is our way of calling , this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes in front of cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rest in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra argues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and historical and compl@@ acent negli@@ gence of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics of 2015 . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; by Felix F. Sei@@ dler . Felix is a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheitspolitik . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and permanently station@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but after several reports about Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP is increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal matters , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a gyp@@ sy is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , is the fact that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , it is now that the police proc@@ laim the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made headlines . a fruit sales@@ man died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ade , mainly by the Assad regime to loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; the Syria institutes are located in Damascus and surrounding areas , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib , about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the region is particularly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 promp@@ ted the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the UN and other human rights organizations , that the massacre of the Assad regime was committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led people to be dependent on local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional dishes cultivated in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian food . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the project , Ab@@ o Nabil , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;

the initiative is dependent on gener@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of fuel shortage , locally produced fuel from plastic is used to supply gener@@ ators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started producing fung@@ al seeds from the regions , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger pot . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people for a variety of reasons &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis zones and we can help humanity .

&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the rolling @-@ out form , which the government had taken after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;

there was no service and no heating . we suspended n@@ ylon off the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ eb came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ a was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed meals twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high per@@ sistence rates . however , it is true that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country are catastro@@ phic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3,000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a recording center if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be deduc@@ ted after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation have either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;

but his irre@@ plac@@ eable life @-@ wil@@ le helped A@@ shar@@ eb to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made several years of working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and a quick snack after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Behind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised for their excellent cuisine in the Italian press .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of its trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;

&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forgot my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kabul , where people can learn in packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey herself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament scrut@@ in@@ ises a bill , which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks within six months , users would have to register their full name as well as their identification number . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the tri@@ ple@@ tion of a penalty payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty parliam@@ ents , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal that would be introduced in the tough@@ er punishment for the President &apos;s ins@@ ult or a high civil servant . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the off@@ ence of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , such a fact would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , such as legal experts of the Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators opposed to the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;

Tunis@@ ian activists hearing checked documents
&quot; in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interrog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interrog@@ ated by the President of the Republic , which expres@@ sly supports a controversial draft bill that would grant business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption . &quot;
&quot; this document , published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , raises a light on how the Presi@@ dential plans to support the legislation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press Code , which journalists justify the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on 09@@ th May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to submit their ID ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Federal Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China need auth@@ orization before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that the registration will be required with full name names . &quot;
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments can be reached within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these rules only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence . &quot;
do you see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , Russia &apos;s c@@ ensu@@ s blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has to register in the state government as an &quot; organiz@@ er of information wi@@ dening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government to organise a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law allows government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently part of websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;

&quot; a Turkish court had blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave the site to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to apply a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
