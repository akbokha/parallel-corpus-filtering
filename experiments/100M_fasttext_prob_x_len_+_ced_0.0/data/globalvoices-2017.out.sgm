<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, recorded American music, read American writers and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporters covering the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"after Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the United States was only reinforced."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shameful love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as he walks with his narrow-mindedness."</seg>
<seg id="15">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and tuned in comments for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won in the Republican presidential elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person? I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program that takes people from around the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trump's view was not consistent with the" Cincinnati Inquirer "by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trump's intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity, which I experienced at Sandy Bahr who fights for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, it adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to nominate Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either divided his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it's unfair to call the Trump voters than Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"one of my friends, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectless, and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most are white, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(p. O..): as much as" "White against all other ethnicities" "; word game from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as it called the big Van Jones, has just killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, anywhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promises and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"at all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had an exchange of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music that is played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years, the La banda de música (music bande) plays in the church: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for their drug abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"come and play with sparkling eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguayan capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste materials:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with re-recorded instruments made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Catacama, where the Recycler began to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembers a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, at the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re-recorded material, and the Recycled Orchestra is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that wild illegal fishing fights.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The report examines all retail channels to provide sector insight.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a bill of the bill to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and Seychelles were swiftly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that had simply refused everything", "he recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and protect resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries to stop by the NRO Stop Illegal fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had expelled the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are equally minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, where it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fisheries can harm ecosystems, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing have been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen in real time, traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in forbidden areas, such as those who suggest that a ship will catch his caught fish on the way on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations may show whether the vessels involved have a fishtail license, where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal background."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing may, on the basis of this information, refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for punishment, as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worth it financially."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, chief director of nfds Africa."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, losing eight members of the Hansa-i network each year due to illegal fishers that invade in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, phantasies of phantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international co-operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "Long said." "before a ship could fly illegally and a country could say 'You can't run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found refuge.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is supposed to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"the fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fishing data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information planes. FISH-i will help to find a crime-operating vessel with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>

<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project where a global system permits the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only sense criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships formerly used without license, and hardly had consequences, know that they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile reached a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats have purchased more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the goal is to allow more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>

<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, make translations still firmeninternally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English language skills are the best, are made to translators - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really."</seg>

<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are widely used - often with funny results.</seg>

<seg id="502">"sixty-five Egyptian MEPs have recently approved a bill to regulate regulation regarding the use and use of social networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by the Parliament, users and users must register social media in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, then a place would be established, which is mandated to use citizens to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with adoption of the law, users and users have to register on the site with their right names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do this, it could bring a penalty of up to six months or a buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraph and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that is running and used on the internet to communicate with others by voice, video content and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the users and users. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to control regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary member and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>

<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" leading research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly in technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they are forced to control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they will be able to set up a strong surveillance system to file citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and assured that no different narration is present on the desktop," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anybody looks at the mourners or the congregations who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in doing so, behind every corpse, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican News Portal Animal político launched the digital project" "aport a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "living with drug trafficking" ")."</seg>

<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who pose to fear. we must show the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader from Animal político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>

<seg id="780">"I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">"I can't be indifferent, or consider this as normal."</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is great. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they hated those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The lack of human dignity is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbourhood would be justified that they were "ungrateful."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to persuade them to be spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was looted with threats." ""</seg>

<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I have asked myself in these terrible days if wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the post "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence drawn by violence."</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">"however, they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul."</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. this project reminds us of those we can't forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "aport a Vivir Con El Narco" "Animal político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="1138">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not based on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of major cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages will not be passed to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided, when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listen often with it, "these events instead" hear these events instead "listening to appreciate, to make sense."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers will first translate their history in their own language, or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation will lead to the audience's audience."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is available in license-free, contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>

<seg id="1190">"this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what the true costs are with which it is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create a sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet-volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was knitted from the Adra prison directory, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us can start thinking about their own fate, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activism has been in custody since March 2012 in custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that they were contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who were themselves as insiders of the Assad government and they were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life, dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to hug them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read English well, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a commission which she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015, when he was detained."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely downward connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "Kalar'still may usually be associated with racism, but the word of itself doesn't automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt about his use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, a chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spage), 'Kalar amic' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>

<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, and users of social networks simply start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underlines that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, you can say that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he was inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old Leier emerges from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, as it adapts to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests about our press, our judiciary, our political system really no answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"in other words, he did not know what he was talking about."</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided it was highly paid to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon publishes his comment on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire co-writing of the conference so that one could understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the manuscript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compares Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said Singapore" "Don't be a country," "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as a leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what awaits me - unless I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review explores the vulnerability of Shanmugam arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "gutted a mistake" "or was it a Freud spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>

<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula. it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican girl, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, tells Mrs. Ramírez, the people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast, they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medication that they cannot pay, she massages them with a balsam from the long journey of exhaustive feet."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a very short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answered with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route, "explained Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans are often travelling along the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers at construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"for months, he has been guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Frau Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answered smiling. "we will always remain in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to kiss her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken and Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but she is not the only radio hope for migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have received migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cook."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackout money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a remote-drawing, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps are to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the passages, the travelers consulate quietly to their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she scrolls in her album with numerous photos."</seg>

<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile phone users received a phone notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the communication, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities refused to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the message of the police, the app could determine and track the sources and the deployment paths of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" damaging information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on online and to remotely control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in a variety of ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in eastern and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority areas like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often classify extreme censuses and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet abstentions."</seg>

<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically speaking, the wig lies warm coffee and the rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one avoids it simply to do basic things - as to the public during Ramadan's water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front man Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert show."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" just "cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila rated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "which continues to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be easy to be silly rhetoric, but actually reflects a clear crystallising reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib restored traditional sex orgasms by creating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honorary morse' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still being said that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support adequate means."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law of crime-fighting in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can be held at indefinite time in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family are necessary that the woman is not going to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to be afraid not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is his music that is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was tortured in politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib accepts the question of the Palestinian identity. "</seg>

<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse repeats itself often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want" - whether faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib was an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya, in order to remember that his comments were taken from the context, twisted and censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib advertises openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nua, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, later on to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can they not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service took several former government members and members of the teacher's association, with the reason that they were critically criticised in social media, which are related to the problems rooted deeply in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs shows only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this way it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib aspires, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will embrace a real and fundamental openness through music, art and literature - and not by bombs, bombs and artificial art. at least, he hopes it."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is concerned, Hdaib will further escalate and therefore also resist opposition."</seg>

<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2185">"this question went out to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga of the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write letters."</seg>

<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians had to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: till now thousands of young people have written letters - messages of love for former guerrilla fighters, to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I'd never thought that someone would forgive me" ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC decided to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of shelter from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the Governor of Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of refuge in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do they just do?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life a person has written something so beautiful, so I answer."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this combatant, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had expected anything else from life than war. the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the hunger death." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>

<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as a war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice emanated from the state to the whole Columbian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country.

<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people who have never found hearing and have no right to vote, and to recognize that the people whom I often have seen as monsters, and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>

<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without reference, without anything."</seg>

<seg id="2305">Came up and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you're going to be safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>

<seg id="2310">"only to prove it, it is the number 115."</seg>

<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed here?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for me, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who had scanned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there is not a lot of people there.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives, in order to put Kadyrov's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"in Chechnya, I had a Bob."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think that before 2003, I was already known throughout the Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In serious!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much more secure than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"in the end, Russia wanted to bring us back to the" civilisation, "but finally left us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had painted eyelashes and tubbled jeans and shorts.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has never bent over a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Spotte is not about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say to children, when they mourn over the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes closed to you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never chased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had ventured and laughed before, gazed at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gay bars."</seg>

<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not be ashamed for my body.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought-through scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminists in general."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money nowadays despite the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and threefold among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I am talking to skin color, on racism, black women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused with racism and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectionals decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women should come together to" "raise their voices and" "Kumbaya, my Lord", "to reach equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women at two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about the fact that black women and women of other ethnic and hereditary people earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with migration background often referred to school as white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all men, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, which refuses to take into account injustices in their mind, which relate both to gender and skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a feminist-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that, moreover, absorb our customs and customs to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overcutting skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "still lies in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself full of feminism and to join the Movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming yourself (example: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even spiritual elements can be revered to the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">His mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his municipality."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we don't have any water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work focuses on persecuted, little substantial subcultures and is characterised by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with their help suppressed communities, their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weightlossy) that reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time passed and the police said that their testimony would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, the Actended ad of Ada Báez was not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are offended at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really misused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research facility in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers currently available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of Hizb ut Tahrir / Wilayah Pakistan convened."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace prisons. 86% of women were used here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually indicated."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"there are two women who do not do this," "she declared at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"ISO-8859-7 (Greek) iso-8859-8 (Hebrew, visual) iso-8859-8-i (Hebrew, logical) iso-8859-9 (Turkish)"</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want it, but then she gave up. this should always be regrettable."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but for two years she brought the psychological violence on its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious ones:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too subservient, because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long ago, and didn't leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the yo te creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias, everything started with mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an immeasurable legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"China, People's Republic of | Beijing Branch Office"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the advert of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in the use of laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# forYOU)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain the femicide on a self-perpetual crime and to punish the harsher as it is in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the Legislature has changed in some respects to also win the deputies for the law, fearing that the way for decriminalising abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had been envisaged, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) travel costs that have to bear the victims of violence at present, if they just provide an ad and receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems world-wide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties such as OutredInsert, the first plant that has grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years, Morton's work was only limited by his own ingenuity and the question of how many sage types he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more ointments were patented and that he could not use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents tend not only for individual species but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or milled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still needs salads, he needs to be more difficult for it, since his work is becoming more and more difficult for his work."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if a boulder would lie in a river that I have to dump into.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salad variety because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, U.S. breeders may commit that other seeds can be freely used by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"Hemp exhibition, museum of natural history Fribourg, CH Book for children, 1920 Botanic representations"</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Noerr Firm of the year for the Mittelstand Menold Bezler Startup</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"independent breeders would try to use the latter, or only little, by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that other seed companies are still freely available, as opposed to patenting seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited, is constantly shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in their doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts like Luby suggest that massive congested plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown so farmed that they have specifically desired characteristics - such by which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"against this background, papers focusing on reasons for, or on results or measurement of such matching problems are particularly welcome. call for Papers 12th IWH / IAB-Workshop on Labour Market Policies Online Survey of the IAB web presence"</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto said that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property enters other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varietal innovations. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years waiting until a patent expires. certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" we do not create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them, and as breeders, we have no idea how plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and OSSI board member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" anyone who is growing a variety is also breeding his own values. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of herbicides, growing in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto), they create the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent it is for 20 years protected from competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be a leader in" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on a" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the OSSI commitment cannot simply be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventional farmed plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douglas, responsible for Hivos's program for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organisation is currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems for which planned next year will be the official start of the start."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the International Nonprofit Development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context, by the Luby of OSSI, hopes that more people will see him soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has especially respected where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role," said Luby. "we now try to make clear to the people that even more behind their food."</seg>
